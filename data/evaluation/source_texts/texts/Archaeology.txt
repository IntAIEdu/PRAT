There are two forms of the layer interface, the horizontal and the upstanding. Horizontal layer interfaces are the surfaces of strata which have been deposited or created in a more or less horizontal state and their extent is equal to that of the layers. They have the same stratigraphic relationships as the deposits and are recorded as an integral part of the layers. A horizontal layer interface will be recorded on a plan which shows the boundary contours of the deposit and, therefore, the limits of the interface. The relief or topography of the horizontal layer interface is recorded by a series of spot-heights, which can later be turned into a contour plan. When a group of these interfaces is defined as a major surface, they comprise a period interface. As a horizontal layer interface is equal to the extent of a deposit, the surface of which it forms, it is not usually necessary to distinguish it from the deposit when labelling the units of stratification. On occasion, it will be necessary to identify a part of this type of surface and record it as a separate unit of stratification.
