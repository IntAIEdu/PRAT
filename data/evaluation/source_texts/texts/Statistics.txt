A formal definition of probability begins with a sample space, often written S. This sample space is any set that lists all possible outcomes of some event. A probability model consists of a nonempty set called the sample space S; a collection of events that are subsets of S. A probability model also requires a probability measure, usually written P, assigning a probability between 0 and 1 to each event. Once we have a probability model, we may define random variables for that probability model. Intuitively, a random variable assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome in the sample space. If the sample space S is finite, then one possible probability measure on S is the uniform probability measure, which assigns probability 1/|S| to each outcome. We say that events are independent to indicate that the occurrence of one does not have any influence on the probability of the other occurring. When we consider joint events, the probability measure on S we need is the conditional probability measure. The conditional probability of A given B, written P(A | B), stands for the fraction of the time that A occurs once we know that B occurs. It is computed as the ratio of the probability that A and B both occur, divided by the probability that B occurs.
