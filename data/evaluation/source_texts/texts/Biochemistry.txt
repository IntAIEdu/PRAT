A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is called a catalyst, and the molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Most enzymes are proteins and perform the critical task of speeding up chemical reactions inside the cell. Most of the reactions critical to a living cell happen too slowly at normal temperatures to be of any use to the cell. Without enzymes to speed up these reactions, life could not persist. Enzymes speed up these reactions by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and -forming processes take place more easily. It is important to remember that enzymes do not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the amount of energy present in the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go forward (Figure 1). Activation energy is the amount of energy required for a reaction to proceed. Heating a chemical reaction adds energy, which can provide the needed activation energy. However, heating chemical reactions to the temperature at which they will proceed is not an option for cells. Instead, cells use enzymes that work by lowering the energy required to make the reaction happen. An enzyme is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has been catalyzed, the enzyme is able to participate in other reactions. Cells do not have to make a new enzyme every time they want to perform a specific chemical reaction.
