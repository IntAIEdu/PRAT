1	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%ANALOG_TELEPHONE_ADAPTER	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	ANALOG TELEPHONE ADAPTER	316	1	For instance, to receive calls, a Skype user must leave his or her PC connected to the Internet and available to the Skype system, which means that some of the PC's resources may be used to support other Skype communications without the PC owner's awareness-a feature that has generated some resistance.	A second form of voice over internet protocol consists of analog telephone adapters, which are devices that allow a user to connect his or her traditional telephone to phone service provided by an access internet service provider.	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.
2	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	3	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
3	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	345	3	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.
4	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%END_SYSTEM	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	END SYSTEM	188	4	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.	The devices that individual users connect to the access internet service providers are known as end systems or hosts.	These end systems may be laptops or PCs, but increasingly range over a multitude of other devices including telephones, video cameras, automobiles, and home appliances.
5	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%HOT_SPOT	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	HOT SPOT	205	2	These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an end system or to a customer's router to which multiple end systems are connected.	This latter tactic is popular for individual residences where a local hot spot is created by a router / access point connected to an access internet service provider by means of existing cable or telephone lines.	Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.
6	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%INTRANET	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	INTRANET	186	2	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
7	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%INTRANET	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	INTRANET	186	3	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
8	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%REGISTERED_DOMAIN	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	REGISTERED DOMAIN	257	1	For example, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the Internet as KingsandQueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its own network, maintain a link from this network to the Internet, and implement its own name server.	In this case, the club can contract with an access internet service provider to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the internet service provider.	Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the internet service provider, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the internet service provider to have that name included in the internet service provider's name server.
9	ACCESS_POINT%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	ACCESS POINT	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	193	1	Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.	The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.
10	ACCESS_POINT%GATEWAY	ACCESS POINT	GATEWAY	113	4	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.	Methods of Process Communication
11	ACCESS_POINT%HOT_SPOT	ACCESS POINT	HOT SPOT	194	5	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.	The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.	Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.
12	ACCESS_POINT%HOT_SPOT	ACCESS POINT	HOT SPOT	205	5	These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an end system or to a customer's router to which multiple end systems are connected.	This latter tactic is popular for individual residences where a local hot spot is created by a router / access point connected to an access internet service provider by means of existing cable or telephone lines.	Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.
13	ACCESS_POINT%ROUTER	ACCESS POINT	ROUTER	101	1	When a machine in one of the wifi networks wants to send a message to a machine in the ethernet network, it first sends the message to the access point in its network.	From there, the access point sends the message to its associated router, and this router forwards the message to the router at the Ethernet.	There the message is given to a machine on the bus, and that machine then forwards the message to its final destination in the Ethernet.
14	ACCESS_POINT%STAR	ACCESS POINT	STAR	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
15	ACCESS_POINT%WIFI_NETWORK	ACCESS POINT	WIFI NETWORK	69	1	After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or busy channel requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.	To solve this problem, some wifi networks require that each machine send a short " request " message to the access point and wait until the access point acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire message.	If the access point is busy because it is dealing with a " hidden terminal ", it will ignore the request, and the requesting machine will know to wait.
16	ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_SERVICE%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM_LOOKUP	ADDRESS TRANSLATION SERVICE	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM LOOKUP	247	1	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.	Thus, for a machine to be accessible by means of a mnemonic domain name, that name must be represented in a name server within the domain name system.
17	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%DOMAIN	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	DOMAIN	225	2	For this reason the Internet has an alternative addressing system in which machines are identified by mnemonic names.	This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a " region " of the Internet operated by a single authority such as a university, club, company, or government agency.	The word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the Internet.
18	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%FORWARDING_TABLE	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	FORWARDING TABLE	108	1	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
19	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	2	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
20	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	3	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
21	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_VERSION_FOUR	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION FOUR	590	1	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.	To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of internet protocol known as IPv6 (internet protocol version six), which uses internet addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.

23	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%IPV6	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	IPV6	591	1	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.	To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of internet protocol known as IPv6 (internet protocol version six), which uses internet addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.	The process of converting from internet protocol version four to internet protocol version six is currently underway-this is the conversion that was alluded to in our introduction of Internet addresses in Section 4.2-and it is expected that the use of 32-bit addresses within the Internet will be extinct by 2025.
24	ANALOG_COMMUNICATION%ANALOG_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE	ANALOG COMMUNICATION	ANALOG NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE	207	1	Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.	Issues arising from these legacy analog linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.
25	ANALOG_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE%LEGACY_ANALOG_LINKAGE	ANALOG NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE	LEGACY ANALOG LINKAGE	208	1	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.	Issues arising from these legacy analog linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.	The main arteries of wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, and many local area networks are relatively easy to modernize with high-speed digital technology such as fiber optics, but it can be far costlier to replace the existing copper telephone lines and coaxial cables that connect these arteries to each individual home or office.
26	ANALOG_NETWORK%LAST_MILE_PROBLEM	ANALOG NETWORK	LAST MILE PROBLEM	208	1	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.

27	ANALOG_VOICE_SIGNAL%1G	ANALOG VOICE SIGNAL	1G	332	1	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
28	APPLICATION_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	APPLICATION LAYER	PORT NUMBER	544	2	Determining which unit within the application layer should receive an incoming message is an important task of the transport layer.	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.
29	APPLICATION_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	APPLICATION LAYER	PORT NUMBER	545	2	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.	Users of the Internet rarely need to be concerned with port numbers because the common applications have universally accepted port numbers.
30	APPLICATION_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	APPLICATION LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	565	1	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
31	APPLICATION_LAYER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	APPLICATION LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	511	3	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
32	APPLICATION_LAYER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	APPLICATION LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	514	3	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.	Toward this latter goal, the transport layer divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet as individual units.
33	APPLICATION_LAYER%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	APPLICATION LAYER	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	565	1	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
34	APPLICATION%APPLICATION_LAYER	APPLICATION	APPLICATION LAYER	550	1	In summary, communication over the Internet involves the interaction of four layers of software.	The application layer deals with messages from the application's point of view.	The transport layer converts these messages into segments that are compatible with the Internet and reassembles messages that are received before delivering them to the appropriate application.
35	ASCII_CHARACTER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	ASCII CHARACTER	INTERNET PROTOCOL	278	1	In line 3, the remote server acknowledges the name of the sending server.	Most internet protocols are not necessarily transmitted in ASCII characters so easily interpreted by a human.	To be sure, the quaint politeness of " pleased to meet you " in line 3 is neither appreciated by the software on either end of this connection, nor essential to simple mail transfer protocol's proper function.
36	ASCII_CHARACTER%MULTIPURPOSE_INTERNET_MAIL_EXTENSION	ASCII CHARACTER	MULTIPURPOSE INTERNET MAIL EXTENSION	298	1	Other protocols come into play for other aspects of transporting email.	Because simple mail transfer protocol was initially designed for transferring text messages encoded with ASCII, additional protocols such as multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) have been developed to convert non-ASCII data to simple mail transfer protocol compatible form.	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.
37	ASCII%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	ASCII	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	376	1	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.
38	AUDITING_SOFTWARE%FIREWALL	AUDITING SOFTWARE	FIREWALL	672	1	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
39	BIT_PATTERN%128-BIT_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	128-BIT ADDRESS	217	1	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.
40	BIT_PATTERN%32-BIT_INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	32-BIT INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	222	1	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.	Addresses in bit-pattern form (even when compressed using dotted decimal notation) are rarely conducive to human consumption.
41	BIT_PATTERN%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	BIT PATTERN	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	716	4	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
42	BIT_PATTERN%DOTTED_DECIMAL_NOTATION	BIT PATTERN	DOTTED DECIMAL NOTATION	221	1	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.
43	BIT_PATTERN%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	221	2	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.
44	BIT_PATTERN%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	222	2	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.	Addresses in bit-pattern form (even when compressed using dotted decimal notation) are rarely conducive to human consumption.
45	BIT_PATTERN%MNEMONIC_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	242	1	For example, if Yoyodyne Corporation was assigned the domain name yoyodyne.com, then an individual computer at Yoyodyne might have a name such as overthruster.propulsion.yoyodyne.com, meaning that the computer overthruster is in the subdomain propulsion within the domain yoyodyne within the Top-Level Domain com.	We should emphasize that the dotted notation used in mnemonic addresses is not related to the dotted decimal notation used to represent addresses in bit pattern form.	Although mnemonic addresses are convenient for humans, messages are always transferred over the Internet by means of internet protocol addresses.
46	BIT%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	BIT	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	217	1	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.
47	BODY%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	BODY	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
48	BRIDGE%ROUTER	BRIDGE	ROUTER	98	3	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
49	BRIDGE%SWITCH	BRIDGE	SWITCH	84	3	A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.	A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).
50	BRIDGE%SWITCH	BRIDGE	SWITCH	86	3	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).	As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for other spokes.	Moreover, each message that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.
51	BROWSER%APPLET	BROWSER	APPLET	471	1	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.	Another approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to first transfer a webpage to a browser and then transfer additional program units called applets (written in the language Java) to the browser as requested within the hypertext markup language source document.	Still another approach is the system Flash (developed by Macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.
52	BROWSER%CLIENT	BROWSER	CLIENT	449	2	Consider now the steps that would be required for a browser to retrieve the simple webpage shown in Figure 4.10 and display it on the browser's computer screen.	First, playing the role of a client, the browser would use the information in a uniform resource locator (perhaps obtained from the person using the browser) to contact the webserver controlling access to the page and ask that a copy of the page be transferred to it.	The server would respond by sending the text document displayed in Figure 4.10a to the browser.
53	BROWSER%CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY	BROWSER	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	3	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
54	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	378	4	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.
55	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	379	4	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.	The process is analogous to adding typesetting directions to a plain typed text (perhaps using a red pen) so that a typesetter will know how the material should appear in its final form.
56	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	264	3	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
57	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	3	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
58	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	373	3	For example, the uniform resource locator http://www.google.com will lead to the home page of Google, which contains hyperlinks to the services, products, and documents relating to the company.	To further simplify locating websites, many browsers assume that the hypertext transfer protocol protocol should be used if no protocol is identified.	These browsers correctly retrieve the Google home page when given the " uniform resource locator " consisting merely of www .google. com.
59	BROWSER%JAVASCRIPT	BROWSER	JAVASCRIPT	469	1	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.	An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language JavaScript (developed by Netscape Communications, Inc.) within the hypertext markup language source document for the webpage.	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.
60	BROWSER%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	BROWSER	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	690	2	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.	Some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.
61	BROWSER%TAG	BROWSER	TAG	413	1	The term src is short for " source ", meaning that the information following the equal sign indicates the source of the image to be displayed.	When the browser finds this tag, it will send a message to the hypertext transfer protocol server at Images. com requesting the image called OurPic.jpg and then display the image appropriately.	If we moved the image tag to the end of the document just before the < / body > tag, then the browser would display the image at the bottom of the webpage.
62	BROWSER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	BROWSER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	362	4	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.
63	BROWSER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	BROWSER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	366	4	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.	Sometimes a uniform resource locator might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in Figure 4.8.
64	BUS_NETWORK%BRIDGE	BUS NETWORK	BRIDGE	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
65	BUS_NETWORK%BRIDGE	BUS NETWORK	BRIDGE	79	3	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.
66	BUS_NETWORK%CARRIER_SENSE	BUS NETWORK	CARRIER SENSE	43	3	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
67	BUS_NETWORK%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	BUS NETWORK	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
68	BUS_NETWORK%ETHERNET_NETWORK	BUS NETWORK	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	2	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
69	BUS_NETWORK%ETHERNET_PROTOCOL	BUS NETWORK	ETHERNET PROTOCOL	76	1	This can be done by connecting the networks to form a larger version of the same " type " of network.	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.
70	BUS_NETWORK%HUB	BUS NETWORK	HUB	33	2	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
71	BUS_NETWORK%HUB	BUS NETWORK	HUB	34	2	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.	All it does is relay any signal it receives (with perhaps some amplification) back out to all the machines connected to it.
72	BUS_NETWORK%MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	BUS NETWORK	MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.

This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
74	BUS_NETWORK%REPEATER	BUS NETWORK	REPEATER	78	3	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.
75	BUS_NETWORK%ROUTER	BUS NETWORK	ROUTER	99	1	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.	When a machine in one of the wifi networks wants to send a message to a machine in the ethernet network, it first sends the message to the access point in its network.
76	BUS_NETWORK%SWITCH	BUS NETWORK	SWITCH	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
77	BUS_NETWORK%SWITCH	BUS NETWORK	SWITCH	84	3	A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.	A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).
78	BUS%BRIDGE	BUS	BRIDGE	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.

79	BUS%BUS_NETWORK	BUS	BUS NETWORK	29	3	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.	The distinction is whether the machines in the network envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central machine.

81	BUS%BUS_NETWORK	BUS	BUS NETWORK	31	4	The distinction is whether the machines in the network envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central machine.	For instance, a bus network might not appear as a long bus from which computers are connected over short links as depicted in Figure 4.1.	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.
82	BUS%ETHERNET	BUS	ETHERNET	24	2	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).

87	BUS%SHORT_BUS	BUS	SHORT BUS	32	2	For instance, a bus network might not appear as a long bus from which computers are connected over short links as depicted in Figure 4.1.

90	BYTE%BIT_PATTERN	BYTE	BIT PATTERN	221	1	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.
91	CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
92	CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
93	CARRIER_SENSE%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	CARRIER SENSE	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	1	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
94	CARRIER_SENSE%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE	LINK LAYER	530	2	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
95	CARRIER_SENSE%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE	LINK LAYER	531	2	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.
96	CARRIER_SENSE%MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	CARRIER SENSE	MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
97	CENTRAL_ACCESS_POINT%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	CENTRAL ACCESS POINT	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	4	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.
98	CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY%CERTIFICATE	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	CERTIFICATE	711	1	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.	Many commercial certificate authorities are now available on the Internet, although it is also common for organizations to maintain their own certificate authorities in order to maintain tighter control over the security of the organization's communication.
99	CHANNEL%BUSY_CHANNEL	CHANNEL	BUSY CHANNEL	64	2	Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only if the channel has remained silent throughout that period.	If a busy channel is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.	Once this period is exhausted, the machine is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation.
100	CHANNEL%SILENT_CHANNEL	CHANNEL	SILENT CHANNEL	65	2	If a busy channel is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.	Once this period is exhausted, the machine is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation.	This means that collisions between " newcomers " and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a " newcomer " is not allowed to claim a silent channel until any machine that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.
101	CLIENT_SIDE%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	CLIENT SIDE	INTERNET PROTOCOL	484	1	If the server blindly executes any program sent to it by a client, security breaches and potential damage at the server could result.	4.4 internet protocols	In this section we investigate how messages are transferred over the Internet.
102	CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY%FLASH	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	FLASH	472	2	Another approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to first transfer a webpage to a browser and then transfer additional program units called applets (written in the language Java) to the browser as requested within the hypertext markup language source document.	Still another approach is the system Flash (developed by Macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.
103	CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	469	1	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.	An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language JavaScript (developed by Netscape Communications, Inc.) within the hypertext markup language source document for the webpage.	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.
104	CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY%JAVASCRIPT	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	JAVASCRIPT	469	2	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.	An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language JavaScript (developed by Netscape Communications, Inc.) within the hypertext markup language source document for the webpage.	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.
105	CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY%SEARCH_ENGINE	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	SEARCH ENGINE	463	1	Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.	In this case a user at the client specifies a topic of interest (a client-side activity), which is then transferred to the search engine where a customized webpage identifying documents of possible interest is constructed (a server-side activity) and sent back to the client.	Still another example occurs in the case of Web mail-an increasingly popular means by which computer users are able to access their email by means of Web browsers.
106	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%CLIENT	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	CLIENT	118	1	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.
107	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
108	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%FILE_SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	FILE SERVER	125	1	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
109	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	129	3	Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model.	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.
110	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	3	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
111	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	136	3	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).	One reason that the peer-to-peer model is replacing the client/server model for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one server.	This lack of a centralized base of operation leads to a more efficient system.
112	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%PRINT_SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	PRINT SERVER	121	1	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.	In this case the printer played the role of a server (often called a print server), and the other machines were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the print server.	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.
113	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	SERVER	118	1	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.
114	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	461	2	On the basis of this information, the customer would specify the destinations of interest and desired dates of travel (a client-side activity).	This information would then be transferred back to the agent's server where it would be used to construct the appropriate customized webpage (a server-side activity), which would then be sent to the customer's browser.	Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.
115	CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL%SWARM	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	SWARM	135	2	The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).	One reason that the peer-to-peer model is replacing the client/server model for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one server.
116	CLIENT%ACTIVE_SERVER_PAGE	CLIENT	ACTIVE SERVER PAGE	477	1	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.
117	CLIENT%APPLICATION_LAYER	CLIENT	APPLICATION LAYER	508	4	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
118	CLIENT%BROWSER	CLIENT	BROWSER	359	1	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
119	CLIENT%CLIENT_SIDE	CLIENT	CLIENT SIDE	480	1	Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and servers to execute programs on the other's machine.	The fact that webservers routinely transfer programs to clients where they are executed leads to ethical questions on the server side and security questions on the client side.	If the client blindly executes any program sent to it by a webserver, it opens itself to malicious activities by the server.
120	CLIENT%CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY	CLIENT	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	3	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
121	CLIENT%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	CLIENT	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	1	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
122	CLIENT%ELECTRONIC_COMMUNICATION_PRIVACY_ACT	CLIENT	ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT	744	1	Questions involving an employer's right to monitor the communications of employees and the extent to which an internet service provider is authorized to access the information being communicated by its clients have been given considerable thought.	In the United States, many of these questions are addressed by the electronic communication privacy act (ECPA) of 1986, which has its origins in legislation to control wiretapping.	Although the act is lengthy, its intent is captured in a few short excerpts.
123	CLIENT%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	CLIENT	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
124	CLIENT%JAVASERVER_PAGE	CLIENT	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	1	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
125	CLIENT%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	CLIENT	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	1	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
126	CLIENT%PROXY_SERVER	CLIENT	PROXY SERVER	660	4	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
127	CLIENT%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	CLIENT	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
128	CLIENT%SPYWARE	CLIENT	SPYWARE	653	1	Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a computer is by establishing contact through a " hole " left by a nonexistent server.	In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine server on the infected computer by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware's findings.	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.
129	CLOUD_COMPUTING%CLOUD	CLOUD COMPUTING	CLOUD	161	1	Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.	Services such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud allow clients to rent virtual computers by the hour, without concern for where the computer hardware is actually located.
130	CLUSTER_COMPUTE%GRID_COMPUTE	CLUSTER COMPUTE	GRID COMPUTE	155	2	Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability-because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable-and load-balancing-because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.	Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.	Grid computing can involve specialized software to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the machines participating in a grid.
131	COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%ACCESS_POINT	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	ACCESS POINT	69	1	After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or busy channel requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.	To solve this problem, some wifi networks require that each machine send a short " request " message to the access point and wait until the access point acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire message.	If the access point is busy because it is dealing with a " hidden terminal ", it will ignore the request, and the requesting machine will know to wait.
132	COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%BUSY_CHANNEL	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	BUSY CHANNEL	64	1	Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only if the channel has remained silent throughout that period.	If a busy channel is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.	Once this period is exhausted, the machine is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation.
133	COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%LINK_LAYER	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	LINK LAYER	531	1	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.
134	COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%SILENT_CHANNEL	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	SILENT CHANNEL	65	1	If a busy channel is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.	Once this period is exhausted, the machine is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation.	This means that collisions between " newcomers " and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a " newcomer " is not allowed to claim a silent channel until any machine that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.
135	COLLISION_DETECTION%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	COLLISION DETECTION	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	1	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.
136	COMBINE_NETWORK%BRIDGE	COMBINE NETWORK	BRIDGE	77	1	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
137	COMBINE_NETWORK%REPEATER	COMBINE NETWORK	REPEATER	77	1	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
138	COMBINE_NETWORK%SWITCH	COMBINE NETWORK	SWITCH	77	1	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.

The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
139	COMMON_GATEWAY_INTERFACE%SERVLET	COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE	SERVLET	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
140	COMPUTER_NETWORK%INTERNET	COMPUTER NETWORK	INTERNET	166	1	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
141	COMPUTER_NETWORK%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	COMPUTER NETWORK	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	9	1	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
142	COMPUTER_NETWORK%METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK	COMPUTER NETWORK	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	9	1	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).

145	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	COMPUTER SYSTEM	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	1	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
146	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%NETWORK	COMPUTER SYSTEM	NETWORK	1	2		The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.
147	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%NETWORK	COMPUTER SYSTEM	NETWORK	1	3		The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.
148	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%TROJAN_HORSE	COMPUTER SYSTEM	TROJAN HORSE	613	2	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.	Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
149	COMPUTER%BOTNET	COMPUTER	BOTNET	633	1	To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given.	Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages.	Inherent, then, in denial of service attacks is the availability of unsuspecting computers to use as accomplices.
150	COMPUTER%BROWSER	COMPUTER	BROWSER	356	3	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
151	COMPUTER%BUS	COMPUTER	BUS	23	1	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
152	COMPUTER%BUS_NETWORK	COMPUTER	BUS NETWORK	33	1	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
153	COMPUTER%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	COMPUTER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
154	COMPUTER%CLOUD_COMPUTING	COMPUTER	CLOUD COMPUTING	160	2	Enabled by the growing connectivity of the Internet, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home PCs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.	Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.
155	COMPUTER%CLUSTER_COMPUTE	COMPUTER	CLUSTER COMPUTE	152	3	Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.
156	COMPUTER%COMPUTER_SYSTEM	COMPUTER	COMPUTER SYSTEM	1	5		The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.
157	COMPUTER%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE	COMPUTER	DENIAL OF SERVICE	630	2	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
158	COMPUTER%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK	COMPUTER	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	634	1	Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages.	Inherent, then, in denial of service attacks is the availability of unsuspecting computers to use as accomplices.	This is why all PC users are discouraged from leaving their computers connected to the Internet when not in use.
159	COMPUTER%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	COMPUTER	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	2	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
160	COMPUTER%FIREWALL	COMPUTER	FIREWALL	650	3	Masquerading as a party other than one's self is known as spoofing.	Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains.	For example, if a computer is not being used as a webserver, a name server, or an email server, then a firewall should be installed at that computer to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.
161	COMPUTER%HUB	COMPUTER	HUB	33	1	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
162	COMPUTER%INTERNET	COMPUTER	INTERNET	166	2	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
163	COMPUTER%INTERNET	COMPUTER	INTERNET	169	2	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
164	COMPUTER%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	COMPUTER	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	303	1	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.	In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.
165	COMPUTER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	COMPUTER	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	1	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
166	COMPUTER%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	COMPUTER	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
167	COMPUTER%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	COMPUTER	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	11	4	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.	In contrast, a local area network normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.	For example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a local area network.
168	COMPUTER%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	COMPUTER	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	1	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.

In contrast, a local area network normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.
173	COMPUTER%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	COMPUTER	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	301	1	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.
174	COMPUTER%PROTOCOL	COMPUTER	PROTOCOL	41	1	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.	As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of messages among computers in a network.	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.
175	COMPUTER%ROUTER	COMPUTER	ROUTER	97	4	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
176	COMPUTER%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	COMPUTER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	1	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
177	COMPUTER%SPYWARE	COMPUTER	SPYWARE	620	2	Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.	Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.	Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.
178	COMPUTER%STAR	COMPUTER	STAR	23	1	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
179	COMPUTER%STAR_NETWORK	COMPUTER	STAR NETWORK	27	1	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.
180	COMPUTER%SUPERCOMPUTER	COMPUTER	SUPERCOMPUTER	153	1	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.	Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability-because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable-and load-balancing-because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.

Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
182	COMPUTER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	COMPUTER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	366	2	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.	Sometimes a uniform resource locator might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in Figure 4.8.
183	COMPUTER%VIRTUAL_COMPUTER	COMPUTER	VIRTUAL COMPUTER	162	1	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.	Services such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud allow clients to rent virtual computers by the hour, without concern for where the computer hardware is actually located.	Google Drive and Google Apps allow users to collaborate on information or build Web services without needing to know how many computers are working on the problem or where the relevant data are stored.
184	COMPUTER%VIRUS	COMPUTER	VIRUS	606	3	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
185	COMPUTER%VIRUS	COMPUTER	VIRUS	608	3	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.	When executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the computer.	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.
186	COMPUTER%WEBSERVER	COMPUTER	WEBSERVER	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
187	COMPUTER%WIDE_AREA_NETWORK	COMPUTER	WIDE AREA NETWORK	9	2	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
188	COMPUTER%WORM	COMPUTER	WORM	610	2	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.
189	CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK%ANYCAST	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	ANYCAST	346	1	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.	Internet streaming of high-definition, on-demand video has permeated far more than traditional PCs.
190	DECRYPT%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	DECRYPT	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	718	1	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.	A digital signature can be as simple as the encrypted version of the message itself.	All the sender must do is encrypt the message being transmitted using his or her private-key (the key typically used for decrypting).
191	DECRYPT%PRIVATE-KEY	DECRYPT	PRIVATE-KEY	697	1	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
192	DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK%BOTNET	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	BOTNET	633	1	To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given.	Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages.	Inherent, then, in denial of service attacks is the availability of unsuspecting computers to use as accomplices.
193	DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK%FIREWALL	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	FIREWALL	646	1	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.	This latter function is a tool for terminating a denial of service attack because it provides a means of blocking traffic from the attacking computers.
194	DEVICE%ANALOG_TELEPHONE_ADAPTER	DEVICE	ANALOG TELEPHONE ADAPTER	316	2	For instance, to receive calls, a Skype user must leave his or her PC connected to the Internet and available to the Skype system, which means that some of the PC's resources may be used to support other Skype communications without the PC owner's awareness-a feature that has generated some resistance.	A second form of voice over internet protocol consists of analog telephone adapters, which are devices that allow a user to connect his or her traditional telephone to phone service provided by an access internet service provider.	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.
195	DEVICE%BRIDGE	DEVICE	BRIDGE	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
196	DEVICE%EMBEDDED_VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PHONE	DEVICE	EMBEDDED VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE	318	2	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
197	DEVICE%END_SYSTEM	DEVICE	END SYSTEM	188	2	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.	The devices that individual users connect to the access internet service providers are known as end systems or hosts.	These end systems may be laptops or PCs, but increasingly range over a multitude of other devices including telephones, video cameras, automobiles, and home appliances.
198	DEVICE%HUB	DEVICE	HUB	33	2	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
199	DEVICE%REPEATER	DEVICE	REPEATER	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).

The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.
201	DEVICE%ROUTER	DEVICE	ROUTER	97	2	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
202	DEVICE%SWITCH	DEVICE	SWITCH	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.

203	DIGITAL_SIGNAL%SECOND_GENERATION	DIGITAL SIGNAL	SECOND GENERATION	333	1	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.
204	DIRECTORY_PATH%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	DIRECTORY PATH	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	365	1	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.
205	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%CLOUD_COMPUTING	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	CLOUD COMPUTING	160	4	Enabled by the growing connectivity of the Internet, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home PCs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.	Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.
206	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%CLUSTER_COMPUTE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	CLUSTER COMPUTE	152	4	Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.
207	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	1	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
208	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%GRID_COMPUTE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	GRID COMPUTE	155	3	Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability-because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable-and load-balancing-because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.	Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.	Grid computing can involve specialized software to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the machines participating in a grid.
209	DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM_LOOKUP%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM LOOKUP	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	579	2	After all, a transport layer based on user datagram protocol is more streamlined than a layer based on transmission control protocol, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of user datagram protocol, that option might be the better choice.	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.
210	DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM_LOOKUP	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM LOOKUP	247	2	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.	Thus, for a machine to be accessible by means of a mnemonic domain name, that name must be represented in a name server within the domain name system.
211	DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	269	2	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.
212	DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	272	2	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
213	DOMAIN_NAME%ANTICYBERSQUATTING_CONSUMER_PROTECTION_ACT	DOMAIN NAME	ANTICYBERSQUATTING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT	769	1	How secure can the registration system be?	Finally, as a means of recognizing the scope of legal issues surrounding the Internet, we cite the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 that is designed to protect organizations from impostors who might otherwise establish look-alike domain names (a practice known as cybersquatting).	The act prohibits the use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or " common law trademark ".
214	DOMAIN_NAME%CYBERSQUATTING	DOMAIN NAME	CYBERSQUATTING	769	1	How secure can the registration system be?

The act prohibits the use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or " common law trademark ".
215	DOMAIN_NAME%DOMAIN_NAME_SPECULATION	DOMAIN NAME	DOMAIN NAME SPECULATION	771	1	The act prohibits the use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or " common law trademark ".	One effect is that although the act does not outlaw domain name speculation (the process of registering potentially desirable domain names and later selling the rights to that name), it limits the practice to generic domain names.	Thus, a domain name speculator might legally register a generic name such as GreatUsedCars.com but might not be able to claim rights to the name BigAlUsedCars.com if Big Al is already in the used car business.
216	DOMAIN_NAME%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	DOMAIN NAME	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	246	3	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.
217	DOMAIN_NAME%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	DOMAIN NAME	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	272	3	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.

This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
218	DOMAIN_NAME%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM_LOOKUP	DOMAIN NAME	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM LOOKUP	259	1	Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the internet service provider, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the internet service provider to have that name included in the internet service provider's name server.	This means that all domain name system lookups regarding the new domain name will be directed to the internet service provider's name server, from which the proper translation will be obtained.	In this way, many registered domains can reside within a single internet service provider, each often occupying only a small portion of a single computer.
219	DOMAIN_NAME%MNEMONIC_DOMAIN_NAME	DOMAIN NAME	MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME	228	2	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
220	DOMAIN_NAME%NAME_SERVER	DOMAIN NAME	NAME SERVER	245	1	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
221	DOMAIN_NAME%SUBDOMAINS	DOMAIN NAME	SUBDOMAINS	239	1	Note that domain names are extended to the left and separated by a period.

225	DOMAIN%FIREWALL	DOMAIN	FIREWALL	650	2	Masquerading as a party other than one's self is known as spoofing.	Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains.	For example, if a computer is not being used as a webserver, a name server, or an email server, then a firewall should be installed at that computer to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.
226	DOMAIN%INTERNET_CORPORATION_FOR_ASSIGNED_NAME_AND_NUMBERS	DOMAIN	INTERNET CORPORATION FOR ASSIGNED NAME AND NUMBERS	227	1	The word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the Internet.	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.

228	DOMAIN%REGISTERED_DOMAIN	DOMAIN	REGISTERED DOMAIN	257	2	For example, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the Internet as KingsandQueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its own network, maintain a link from this network to the Internet, and implement its own name server.	In this case, the club can contract with an access internet service provider to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the internet service provider.	Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the internet service provider, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the internet service provider to have that name included in the internet service provider's name server.

232	DOTTED_DECIMAL_NOTATION%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	DOTTED DECIMAL NOTATION	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	220	1	The internet service providers are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to machines within their region of authority.	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).

In brief, the electronic communication privacy act confirms an individual's right to private communication-it is illegal for an internet service provider to release information about the communication of its clients, and it is illegal for unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop on another's communication.	But the electronic communication privacy act leaves room for debate.
234	EMAIL_MESSAGE%END_USER	EMAIL MESSAGE	END USER	270	1	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
235	EMAIL_MESSAGE%PHISHING	EMAIL MESSAGE	PHISHING	625	2	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".	Phishing is often carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more than an old telephone con.	The perpetrator sends email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency.
236	EMAIL_MESSAGE%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	EMAIL MESSAGE	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	2	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.

237	EMAIL_MESSAGE%SPAM	EMAIL MESSAGE	SPAM	638	1	In turn, an unprotected PC represents a significant threat to the integrity of the Internet.	Another problem associated with an abundance of unwanted messages is the proliferation of unwanted junk email, called spam.	However, unlike a denial of service attack, the volume of spam is rarely sufficient to overwhelm the computer system.
238	EMAIL_MESSAGE%SPAM_FILTER	EMAIL MESSAGE	SPAM FILTER	655	1	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.	Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes-an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.	Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.
239	EMAIL_MESSAGE%TROJAN_HORSE	EMAIL MESSAGE	TROJAN HORSE	617	2	In other instances, the trojan horse might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected date.	trojan horses often arrive in the form of attachments to enticing email messages.	When the attachment is opened (that is, when the recipient asks to view the attachment), the misdeeds of the trojan horse are activated.
240	EMAIL%ELECTRONIC_MAIL_SYSTEM	EMAIL	ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM	267	1	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.

242	EMAIL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	EMAIL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	2	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
243	EMAIL%MAIL_SERVER	EMAIL	MAIL SERVER	270	2	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.

247	EMAIL%REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER	EMAIL	REMOTE MAIL SERVER	282	1	Untold millions of these exchanges occur on the network each day, known only to the software agents that transport email across the Internet.	In the simplest case, the remote mail server will take mail.skaro.gov at its word in line 2, accepting that the sending server is the machine named mail from the domain skaro.gov. simple mail transfer protocol is an example of a protocol originally built on trust that has subsequently been abused by spammers and other Internet miscreants.	Modern mail servers must use extended versions of simple mail transfer protocol or their equivalent to help ensure that email is transmitted securely.
248	EMAIL%REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER_PROCESS	EMAIL	REMOTE MAIL SERVER PROCESS	275	1	Similarly, when the server process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.	The transcript of their simple mail transfer protocol exchange might look something like this: In line 1, the remote mail server process answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.

257	ENCRYPTION%PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION_SYSTEM	ENCRYPTION	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM	695	2	After all, intuition would suggest that if a person knows how messages are encrypted, then that person should be able to reverse the encryption process and thus decrypt messages.	But public-key encryption systems defy this intuitive logic.	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.
258	END_USER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	END USER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	2	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
259	ETHERNET_NETWORK%EMBEDDED_VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PHONE	ETHERNET NETWORK	EMBEDDED VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE	319	1	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.	Finally, the current generation of smartphones use wireless voice over internet protocol technology.
260	ETHERNET_NETWORK%LINK_LAYER	ETHERNET NETWORK	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
261	ETHERNET_NETWORK%ROUTER	ETHERNET NETWORK	ROUTER	97	1	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
262	ETHERNET%CARRIER_SENSE	ETHERNET	CARRIER SENSE	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
263	ETHERNET%ETHERNET_NETWORK	ETHERNET	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	2	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
264	ETHERNET%LINK_LAYER	ETHERNET	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
265	EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_STANDARD	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE STANDARD	432	1	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.
266	EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	433	2	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.	Actually, the original version of hypertext markup language was developed before the extensible markup language standard was solidified, and therefore some features of hypertext markup language do not strictly conform to extensible markup language.
267	EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%STANDARD_GENERALIZED_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	STANDARD GENERALIZED MARKUP LANGUAGE	431	1	The extensible markup language (XML) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music example) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.
268	FILE_DISTRIBUTION%SWARM	FILE DISTRIBUTION	SWARM	134	1	In this case, one peer may receive a file from another and then provide that file to other peers.	The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).
269	FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%APPLICATION_LAYER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	APPLICATION LAYER	508	1	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
270	FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_PROXY_SERVER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL PROXY SERVER	670	2	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).
271	FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%PROXY_SERVER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	PROXY SERVER	663	2	Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about the intranet's internal structure-information that can later be used for malicious activity.	To counter this, an organization can establish a proxy server for a particular kind of service (file transfer protocol, hypertext transfer protocol, telnet, etc.).	Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a server of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the proxy server.
272	FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%PROXY_SERVER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	PROXY SERVER	670	2	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).
273	FILE%FILE_SERVER	FILE	FILE SERVER	125	1	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
274	FILE%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	FILE	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
275	FIREWALL%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	FIREWALL	AUDITING SOFTWARE	672	3	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
276	FIREWALL%SPAM_FILTER	FIREWALL	SPAM FILTER	655	2	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.	Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes-an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.	Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.
277	FIREWALL%SPOOFING	FIREWALL	SPOOFING	649	1	Another common role of a firewall at a gateway is to block all incoming messages that have origin addresses within the region accessed through the gateway because such a message would indicate that an outsider is pretending to be a member of the inside region.	Masquerading as a party other than one's self is known as spoofing.	Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains.
278	FORWARD_PROCESS%ADDRESSING_SYSTEM	FORWARD PROCESS	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	104	1	The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward messages in their proper directions.	This forwarding process is based on an internetwide addressing system in which all the devices in an internet (including the machines in the original networks and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.	Thus, each machine in one of the original networks has two addresses: its original " local " address within its own network and its internet address.
279	FORWARD_PROCESS%FORWARDING_TABLE	FORWARD PROCESS	FORWARDING TABLE	108	1	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
280	FORWARD_PROCESS%HOP_COUNT	FORWARD PROCESS	HOP COUNT	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
281	FORWARDING_TABLE%NETWORK_LAYER	FORWARDING TABLE	NETWORK LAYER	524	5	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.
282	FOUR-LEVEL_HIERARCHY%SEVEN-LEVEL_HIERARCHY	FOUR-LEVEL HIERARCHY	SEVEN-LEVEL HIERARCHY	558	1	One standard that has resulted is the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model, produced by the International Organization for Standardization.	This standard is based on a seven-level hierarchy as opposed to the four-level hierarchy we have just described.	It is an often-quoted model because it carries the authority of an international organization, but it has been slow to replace the four-level point of view, mainly because it was established after the four-level hierarchy had already become the de facto standard for the Internet.
283	GATEWAY%FIREWALL	GATEWAY	FIREWALL	645	4	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
284	HEAD%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	HEAD	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
285	HOST%4G	HOST	4G	323	2	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.	Internet Multimedia Streaming
286	HOST%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	HOST	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	269	2	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.
287	HOST%VIRUS	HOST	VIRUS	606	1	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
288	HTTPS%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	HTTPS	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
289	HYPERLINK%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	HYPERLINK	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	1	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
290	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	378	2	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.
291	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
292	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	2	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
293	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	361	2	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.
294	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	WEBSERVER	358	2	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
295	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	2	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.

296	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT%ANCHOR	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	ANCHOR	402	1	Let us suppose that, when the word here is clicked, we want the browser to retrieve and display the page at the uniform resource locator http://crafty.com/demo.html.	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).
297	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT%BODY	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	BODY	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
298	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT%HEAD	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	HEAD	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
299	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT%JAVASCRIPT	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	JAVASCRIPT	469	1	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.	An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language JavaScript (developed by Netscape Communications, Inc.) within the hypertext markup language source document for the webpage.	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.
300	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	430	2	This same style could also be used to develop systems for representing other formats such as mathematical expressions and graphics.	The extensible markup language (XML) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music example) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.
301	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_STANDARD	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE STANDARD	433	1	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.	Actually, the original version of hypertext markup language was developed before the extensible markup language standard was solidified, and therefore some features of hypertext markup language do not strictly conform to extensible markup language.
302	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	384	4	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.

The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
303	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%MARKUP_LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	MARKUP LANGUAGE	433	1	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.	Actually, the original version of hypertext markup language was developed before the extensible markup language standard was solidified, and therefore some features of hypertext markup language do not strictly conform to extensible markup language.
304	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%SEARCH_ENGINE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	SEARCH ENGINE	444	1	The difference is subtle but important.	The semantic approach would allow search engines (websites that assist users in locating Web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".
305	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_OVER_SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL OVER SECURE SOCKET LAYER	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
306	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_SERVER%PORT_NUMBER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER	PORT NUMBER	547	1	Users of the Internet rarely need to be concerned with port numbers because the common applications have universally accepted port numbers.	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.
307	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%HTTPS	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	HTTPS	688	1	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.
308	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%PROXY_SERVER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	PROXY SERVER	663	1	Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about the intranet's internal structure-information that can later be used for malicious activity.	To counter this, an organization can establish a proxy server for a particular kind of service (file transfer protocol, hypertext transfer protocol, telnet, etc.).	Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a server of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the proxy server.
309	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	366	4	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.	Sometimes a uniform resource locator might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in Figure 4.8.
310	HYPERTEXT%ANCHOR_TAG	HYPERTEXT	ANCHOR TAG	403	1	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).	Having added the anchor tags, the webpage will now appear on a computer screen as shown in Figure 4.10b.
311	HYPERTEXT%BROWSER	HYPERTEXT	BROWSER	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
312	HYPERTEXT%BROWSER	HYPERTEXT	BROWSER	356	2	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.

313	HYPERTEXT%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).

The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
316	HYPERTEXT%HYPERTEXT_REFERENCE	HYPERTEXT	HYPERTEXT REFERENCE	403	1	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).	Having added the anchor tags, the webpage will now appear on a computer screen as shown in Figure 4.10b.
317	HYPERTEXT%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	HYPERTEXT	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	2	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

318	HYPERTEXT%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_SERVER	HYPERTEXT	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER	413	1	The term src is short for " source ", meaning that the information following the equal sign indicates the source of the image to be displayed.	When the browser finds this tag, it will send a message to the hypertext transfer protocol server at Images. com requesting the image called OurPic.jpg and then display the image appropriately.	If we moved the image tag to the end of the document just before the < / body > tag, then the browser would display the image at the bottom of the webpage.
319	HYPERTEXT%WEBSERVERS	HYPERTEXT	WEBSERVERS	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
320	INFORMATION%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK	INFORMATION	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	683	1	Encryption	In some cases the purpose of network vandalism is to disrupt the system (as in denial of service attacks), but in other cases the ultimate goal is to gain access to information.	The traditional means of protecting information is to control its access through the use of passwords.
321	INFORMATION%ENCRYPTION	INFORMATION	ENCRYPTION	686	2	However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over networks and internets where messages are relayed by unknown entities.	In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.
322	INFORMATION%PHISHING	INFORMATION	PHISHING	623	1	In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.	As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".
323	INSTANT_MESSAGING%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	INSTANT MESSAGING	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	131	1	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.	The peer-to-peer model is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the Internet.
324	INTERNET_ACCESS%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET ACCESS	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	186	3	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
325	INTERNET_ACCESS%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET ACCESS	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	188	3	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.	The devices that individual users connect to the access internet service providers are known as end systems or hosts.	These end systems may be laptops or PCs, but increasingly range over a multitude of other devices including telephones, video cameras, automobiles, and home appliances.
326	INTERNET_ACCESS%HOT_SPOT	INTERNET ACCESS	HOT SPOT	194	1	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.	The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.	Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.
327	INTERNET_ACCESS%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	INTERNET ACCESS	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	688	1	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.
328	INTERNET_ACCESS%LAST_MILE_PROBLEM	INTERNET ACCESS	LAST MILE PROBLEM	208	1	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.	Issues arising from these legacy analog linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.	The main arteries of wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, and many local area networks are relatively easy to modernize with high-speed digital technology such as fiber optics, but it can be far costlier to replace the existing copper telephone lines and coaxial cables that connect these arteries to each individual home or office.
329	INTERNET_ADDRESS%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_VERSION_FOUR	INTERNET ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION FOUR	589	1	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.
330	INTERNET_ADDRESS%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_VERSION_SIX	INTERNET ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION SIX	591	1	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.	To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of internet protocol known as IPv6 (internet protocol version six), which uses internet addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.	The process of converting from internet protocol version four to internet protocol version six is currently underway-this is the conversion that was alluded to in our introduction of Internet addresses in Section 4.2-and it is expected that the use of 32-bit addresses within the Internet will be extinct by 2025.
331	INTERNET_APPLICATIONS%ELECTRONIC_MAIL	INTERNET APPLICATIONS	ELECTRONIC MAIL	266	1	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.
332	INTERNET_APPLICATIONS%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET APPLICATIONS	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	1	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
333	INTERNET_ARCHITECTURE%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET ARCHITECTURE	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	176	1	The system of networks operated by the internet service providers can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall Internet structure (Figure 4.7).	At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 internet service providers that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international wide area networks.	These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.
334	INTERNET_ARCHITECTURE%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET ARCHITECTURE	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	180	1	An example would be a company that originated as a traditional telephone company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.
335	INTERNET_INFRASTRUCTURE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	2	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.

336	INTERNET_MULTIMEDIA_STREAMING%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	INTERNET MULTIMEDIA STREAMING	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	1	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
337	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%128-BIT_ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	128-BIT ADDRESS	217	1	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.
338	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%32-BIT_INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	32-BIT INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	222	1	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.	Addresses in bit-pattern form (even when compressed using dotted decimal notation) are rarely conducive to human consumption.
339	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_SERVICE	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	ADDRESS TRANSLATION SERVICE	245	1	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
340	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%APPLICATION_LAYER	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	APPLICATION LAYER	513	2	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.
341	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	272	1	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
342	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%INTERNET_CORPORATION_FOR_ASSIGNED_NAME_AND_NUMBERS	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	INTERNET CORPORATION FOR ASSIGNED NAME AND NUMBERS	218	1	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.	The internet service providers are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to machines within their region of authority.

Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.

This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
347	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	HOP COUNT	584	4	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
348	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	HOP COUNT	586	4	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.	Each time an internet protocol network layer forwards a packet, it decrements that packet's hop count by one.	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.
349	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK%4G	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	4G	335	4	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	The Generations of wireless telephones Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.
350	INTERNET_PROTOCOL%4G	INTERNET PROTOCOL	4G	323	2	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

351	INTERNET_PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	3	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.

In the United States, many of these questions are addressed by the electronic communication privacy act (ECPA) of 1986, which has its origins in legislation to control wiretapping.	Although the act is lengthy, its intent is captured in a few short excerpts.

In brief, the electronic communication privacy act confirms an individual's right to private communication-it is illegal for an internet service provider to release information about the communication of its clients, and it is illegal for unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop on another's communication.	But the electronic communication privacy act leaves room for debate.

The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
382	INTERNET%BROWSER	INTERNET	BROWSER	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
383	INTERNET%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	INTERNET	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	1	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
384	INTERNET%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	INTERNET	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	2	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
385	INTERNET%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK	INTERNET	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	630	1	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
386	INTERNET%DOMAIN	INTERNET	DOMAIN	225	1	For this reason the Internet has an alternative addressing system in which machines are identified by mnemonic names.	This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a " region " of the Internet operated by a single authority such as a university, club, company, or government agency.	The word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the Internet.
387	INTERNET%DOMAIN_NAME	INTERNET	DOMAIN NAME	228	2	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
388	INTERNET%DOMAIN_NAME	INTERNET	DOMAIN NAME	769	2	How secure can the registration system be?	Finally, as a means of recognizing the scope of legal issues surrounding the Internet, we cite the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 that is designed to protect organizations from impostors who might otherwise establish look-alike domain names (a practice known as cybersquatting).	The act prohibits the use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or " common law trademark ".
389	INTERNET%EMAIL_MESSAGE	INTERNET	EMAIL MESSAGE	268	1	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
390	INTERNET%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
391	INTERNET%GATEWAY	INTERNET	GATEWAY	109	1	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.
392	INTERNET%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET	HOP COUNT	588	1	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.
393	INTERNET%INTERNET_APPLICATION	INTERNET	INTERNET APPLICATION	200	2	Internet2 is intended as an academic-only system and involves numerous universities working in partnership with industry and government.	The goal is to conduct research in internet applications requiring high bandwidth communication, such as remote access and control of costly state-of-the-art equipment such as telescopes and medical diagnostic devices.	An example of current research involves remote surgery performed by robot hands that mimic the hands of a distant surgeon who views the patient by video.
394	INTERNET%INTERNET_INFRASTRUCTURE	INTERNET	INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE	306	1	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
395	INTERNET%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
396	INTERNET%INTERNET_MULTIMEDIA_STREAMING	INTERNET	INTERNET MULTIMEDIA STREAMING	324	1	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.	Internet Multimedia Streaming	An enormous portion of current Internet traffic is used for transporting audio and video across the Internet in real-time, known as streaming.
397	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL	216	4	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).
398	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL	580	5	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
399	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	2	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
400	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	342	1	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.
401	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	586	1	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.	Each time an internet protocol network layer forwards a packet, it decrements that packet's hop count by one.	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.
402	INTERNET%INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	172	5	As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.	In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).	It is also customary to use the term internet service provider in reference to the networks themselves.
403	INTERNET%INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	218	5	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.	The internet service providers are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to machines within their region of authority.
404	INTERNET%INTERNET_SOFTWARE	INTERNET	INTERNET SOFTWARE	501	3	Each level in the hierarchy has representatives at both the origin and the destination, with the representatives at the destination tending to do the reverse of their counterparts at the origin.	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).
405	INTERNET%INTERNET2	INTERNET	INTERNET2	197	3	A similar technology is used by the cellular telephone industry where hot spots are known as cells and the " routers " generating the cells are coordinated to provide continuous service as an end system moves from one cell to another.	Internet2	Now that the Internet has shifted from a research project to a household commodity, the research community has moved on to a project called Internet2.
406	INTERNET%INTERNET2	INTERNET	INTERNET2	198	3	Internet2	Now that the Internet has shifted from a research project to a household commodity, the research community has moved on to a project called Internet2.	Internet2 is intended as an academic-only system and involves numerous universities working in partnership with industry and government.
407	INTERNET%INTRANET	INTERNET	INTRANET	186	1	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
408	INTERNET%IPV4	INTERNET	IPV4	589	1	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.
409	INTERNET%IPV6	INTERNET	IPV6	591	1	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.	To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of internet protocol known as IPv6 (internet protocol version six), which uses internet addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.	The process of converting from internet protocol version four to internet protocol version six is currently underway-this is the conversion that was alluded to in our introduction of Internet addresses in Section 4.2-and it is expected that the use of 32-bit addresses within the Internet will be extinct by 2025.
410	INTERNET%LAST_MILE_PROBLEM	INTERNET	LAST MILE PROBLEM	208	1	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.	Issues arising from these legacy analog linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.	The main arteries of wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, and many local area networks are relatively easy to modernize with high-speed digital technology such as fiber optics, but it can be far costlier to replace the existing copper telephone lines and coaxial cables that connect these arteries to each individual home or office.
411	INTERNET%LINK_LAYER	INTERNET	LINK LAYER	523	1	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
412	INTERNET%MNEMONIC_DOMAIN_NAME	INTERNET	MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME	228	2	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
413	INTERNET%NETWORK_LAYER	INTERNET	NETWORK LAYER	523	2	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
414	INTERNET%ROUTER	INTERNET	ROUTER	97	2	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
415	INTERNET%SECURE_SHELL	INTERNET	SECURE SHELL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
417	INTERNET%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	180	2	An example would be a company that originated as a traditional telephone company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.
418	INTERNET%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	2	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.
419	INTERNET%TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	185	1	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.
420	INTERNET%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
421	INTERNET%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE	INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	19	5	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.	Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.
422	INTERNET%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE	INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	560	5	It is an often-quoted model because it carries the authority of an international organization, but it has been slow to replace the four-level point of view, mainly because it was established after the four-level hierarchy had already become the de facto standard for the Internet.	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.
423	INTERNET%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_SYSTEM	INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL SYSTEM	322	1	That is, earlier generations of wireless phones only communicated with the telephone company's network using that company's protocols.	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.
424	INTERNET%TRANSPORT_LAYER	INTERNET	TRANSPORT LAYER	514	1	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.	Toward this latter goal, the transport layer divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet as individual units.
425	INTERNET%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	3	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
426	INTERNET%VOIP	INTERNET	VOIP	305	1	In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.
427	INTERNET%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	INTERNET	WORLD WIDE WEB	350	2	4.3 The world wide web	The world wide web had its origins in the work of Tim Berners-Lee who realized the potential of combining internet technology with the concept of linkeddocuments, called hypertext.	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.
428	INTERNET%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	INTERNET	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	2	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
429	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%CLIENT_/_SERVER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	CLIENT / SERVER MODEL	117	1	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
430	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	117	2	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
431	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%P2P	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	P2P	128	1	However, the client/server model is not the only means of interprocess communication.	Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model.	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).
432	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	128	3	However, the client/server model is not the only means of interprocess communication.	Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model.	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).
433	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	2	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
434	INTRANET%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTRANET	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	186	2	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
435	INTRANET%FIREWALL	INTRANET	FIREWALL	645	2	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
436	INTRANET%PROXY_SERVER	INTRANET	PROXY SERVER	661	2	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.	Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about the intranet's internal structure-information that can later be used for malicious activity.
437	INTRANET%PROXY_SERVER	INTRANET	PROXY SERVER	663	2	Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about the intranet's internal structure-information that can later be used for malicious activity.	To counter this, an organization can establish a proxy server for a particular kind of service (file transfer protocol, hypertext transfer protocol, telnet, etc.).	Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a server of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the proxy server.
438	IPV4%IPV6	IPV4	IPV6	591	2	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.

Finally, as a means of recognizing the scope of legal issues surrounding the Internet, we cite the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 that is designed to protect organizations from impostors who might otherwise establish look-alike domain names (a practice known as cybersquatting).	The act prohibits the use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or " common law trademark ".
448	LEGAL_APPROACHES%COMMUNICATION_ASSISTANCE_FOR_LAW_ENFORCEMENT_ACT	LEGAL APPROACHES	COMMUNICATION ASSISTANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT	762	1	One is that to provide these capabilities, a communication system must be constructed and programmed so that communications can be monitored.	To establish such capabilities was the goal of the communications assistance for law enforcement act (CALEA).	It requires telecommunication carriers to modify their equipment to accommodate law enforcement taps-a requirement that has been complex and expensive to meet.
449	LEGAL_APPROACHES%COMPUTER_FRAUD_AND_ABUSE_ACT	LEGAL APPROACHES	COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT	735	1	We begin with the proliferation of malware.	In the United States this problem is addressed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.	It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.
450	LINKEDDOCUMENTS%HYPERTEXT	LINKEDDOCUMENTS	HYPERTEXT	350	1	4.3 The world wide web	The world wide web had its origins in the work of Tim Berners-Lee who realized the potential of combining internet technology with the concept of linkeddocuments, called hypertext.	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.
451	LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	166	3	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
452	LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	3	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
453	LOCAL_MACHINE%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	LOCAL MACHINE	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	4	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
454	LOCAL_MACHINE%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	LOCAL MACHINE	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	301	4	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.
455	MACHINE%ACCESS_POINT	MACHINE	ACCESS POINT	28	4	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
456	MACHINE%BUS	MACHINE	BUS	23	3	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
457	MACHINE%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	MACHINE	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	60	1	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.	The most common approach to collision avoidance is based on giving advantage to machines that have already been waiting for an opportunity to transmit.	The protocol used is similar to Ethernet's carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.
458	MACHINE%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	MACHINE	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	345	1	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.
459	MACHINE%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	MACHINE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	152	1	Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.
460	MACHINE%FILE_SERVER	MACHINE	FILE SERVER	125	1	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
461	MACHINE%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	MACHINE	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	2	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.
462	MACHINE%LOCAL_MACHINE	MACHINE	LOCAL MACHINE	302	1	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.
463	MACHINE%NETWORK	MACHINE	NETWORK	22	1	In contrast, a company such as Novell Inc. might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing these products.	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).
464	MACHINE%PROTOCOL	MACHINE	PROTOCOL	41	1	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.	As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of messages among computers in a network.	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.
465	MACHINE%SERVER	MACHINE	SERVER	117	2	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
466	MACHINE%SILENT_CHANNEL	MACHINE	SILENT CHANNEL	65	1	If a busy channel is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.	Once this period is exhausted, the machine is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation.	This means that collisions between " newcomers " and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a " newcomer " is not allowed to claim a silent channel until any machine that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.
467	MACHINE%STAR	MACHINE	STAR	23	2	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
468	MACHINE%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	MACHINE	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	1	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
469	MACHINE%VIRUS	MACHINE	VIRUS	606	1	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
470	MACHINE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	MACHINE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	1	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
471	MACHINE%WIDE_AREA_NETWORK	MACHINE	WIDE AREA NETWORK	14	2	A metropolitan area network is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.	Finally, a wide area network links machines over a greater distance-perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.	Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.
472	MAGNETIC_DISK%MASS_STORAGE	MAGNETIC DISK	MASS STORAGE	123	2	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.
473	MAIL_SERVER%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	MAIL SERVER	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	272	1	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
474	MAIL_SERVER%END_USER	MAIL SERVER	END USER	270	1	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
475	MAIL_SERVER%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	4	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
476	MAIL_SERVER%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	303	5	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.	In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.
477	MAIL_SERVER%PORT_NUMBER	MAIL SERVER	PORT NUMBER	548	1	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.	In summary, communication over the Internet involves the interaction of four layers of software.
478	MAIL_SERVER%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MAIL SERVER	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	2	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
479	MAIL_SERVER%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MAIL SERVER	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	3	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
480	MAIL_SERVER%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	MAIL SERVER	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	466	1	In this case, the webserver is an intermediary between the client and the client's mail server.	Essentially, the webserver builds webpages that contain information from the mail server (a server-side activity) and sends those pages to the client where the client's browser displays them (a client-side activity).	Conversely, the browser allows the user to create messages (a client-side activity) and sends that information to the webserver, which then forwards the messages to the mail server (a server-side activity) for mailing.
481	MAIL_SERVER%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	269	1	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.
482	MAIL_SERVER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	580	2	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
483	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	1	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
484	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	1	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.
485	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%FIREWALL	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	FIREWALL	644	1	The old adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections.	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.
486	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%PHISHING	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	PHISHING	623	1	In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.	As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".
487	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%PROXY_SERVER	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	PROXY SERVER	659	1	These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.
488	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%SPYWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	600	5	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
489	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%SPYWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	620	5	Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.	Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.	Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.
490	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	600	3	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
491	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	600	4	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
492	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	613	4	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.	Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
493	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%VIRUS	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	VIRUS	600	3	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
494	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%VIRUS	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	VIRUS	606	3	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
495	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%WORM	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	WORM	600	4	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
496	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%WORM	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	WORM	611	4	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.
497	MARKUP_LANGUAGE%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	MARKUP LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	433	1	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.	Actually, the original version of hypertext markup language was developed before the extensible markup language standard was solidified, and therefore some features of hypertext markup language do not strictly conform to extensible markup language.
498	MASS_STORAGE%FILE_SERVER	MASS STORAGE	FILE SERVER	125	1	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
499	MASS_STORAGE%MAGNETIC_DISK	MASS STORAGE	MAGNETIC DISK	123	1	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.
500	MASS_STORAGE%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MASS STORAGE	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	4	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
501	MASS_STORAGE%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MASS STORAGE	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	301	4	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.
502	MASS_STORAGE%VIRUS	MASS STORAGE	VIRUS	609	3	When executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the computer.	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.
503	MESSAGE%ADDRESS	MESSAGE	ADDRESS	104	1	The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward messages in their proper directions.	This forwarding process is based on an internetwide addressing system in which all the devices in an internet (including the machines in the original networks and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.	Thus, each machine in one of the original networks has two addresses: its original " local " address within its own network and its internet address.
504	MESSAGE%APPLICATION_LAYER	MESSAGE	APPLICATION LAYER	503	4	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.	From there it is passed down through the transport and network layers as it is prepared for transmission, and finally it is transmitted by the link layer.
505	MESSAGE%APPLICATION_LAYER	MESSAGE	APPLICATION LAYER	508	4	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
506	MESSAGE%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	MESSAGE	AUDITING SOFTWARE	672	2	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
507	MESSAGE%BRIDGE	MESSAGE	BRIDGE	79	1	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.
508	MESSAGE%CARRIER_SENSE	MESSAGE	CARRIER SENSE	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
509	MESSAGE%CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY	MESSAGE	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	467	1	Essentially, the webserver builds webpages that contain information from the mail server (a server-side activity) and sends those pages to the client where the client's browser displays them (a client-side activity).	Conversely, the browser allows the user to create messages (a client-side activity) and sends that information to the webserver, which then forwards the messages to the mail server (a server-side activity) for mailing.	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.
510	MESSAGE%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	MESSAGE	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	58	1	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.
511	MESSAGE%DECRYPT	MESSAGE	DECRYPT	692	1	Some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.	One of the more fascinating topics in the field of encryption is public-key encryption, which involves techniques by which encryption systems are designed so that having knowledge about how messages are encrypted does not allow one to decrypt messages.	This characteristic is somewhat counterintuitive.
512	MESSAGE%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK	MESSAGE	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	631	2	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.	To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given.
513	MESSAGE%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	MESSAGE	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	716	3	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
514	MESSAGE%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	MESSAGE	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	718	3	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.	A digital signature can be as simple as the encrypted version of the message itself.	All the sender must do is encrypt the message being transmitted using his or her private-key (the key typically used for decrypting).
515	MESSAGE%ENCRYPTION	MESSAGE	ENCRYPTION	686	1	However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over networks and internets where messages are relayed by unknown entities.	In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.
516	MESSAGE%FIREWALL	MESSAGE	FIREWALL	644	4	The old adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections.	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.
517	MESSAGE%FIREWALL	MESSAGE	FIREWALL	645	4	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
518	MESSAGE%FORWARDING_TABLE	MESSAGE	FORWARDING TABLE	108	1	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
519	MESSAGE%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	MESSAGE	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	1	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.
520	MESSAGE%HOP_COUNT	MESSAGE	HOP COUNT	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
521	MESSAGE%INSTANT_MESSAGING	MESSAGE	INSTANT MESSAGING	266	2	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.
522	MESSAGE%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	MESSAGE	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	303	2	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.	In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.
523	MESSAGE%LINK_LAYER	MESSAGE	LINK LAYER	505	1	From there it is passed down through the transport and network layers as it is prepared for transmission, and finally it is transmitted by the link layer.	The message is received by the link layer at the destination and passed back up the hierarchy until it is delivered to the application layer at the message's destination.	Let us investigate this process more thoroughly by tracing a message as it finds its way through the system (Figure 4.14).
524	MESSAGE%NETWORK	MESSAGE	NETWORK	2	1	The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.
525	MESSAGE%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	MESSAGE	NETWORK SOFTWARE	489	1	The Layered Approach to Internet Software	A principal task of networking software is to provide the infrastructure required for transferring messages from one machine to another.	In the Internet, this message-passing activity is accomplished by means of a hierarchy of software units, which perform tasks analogous to those that would be performed if you were to send a gift in a package from the West Coast of the United States to a friend on the East Coast (Figure 4.12).
526	MESSAGE%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MESSAGE	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	301	2	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.
527	MESSAGE%PRIVATE-KEY	MESSAGE	PRIVATE-KEY	697	3	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
528	MESSAGE%PROTOCOL	MESSAGE	PROTOCOL	41	1	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.	As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of messages among computers in a network.	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.
529	MESSAGE%PUBLIC-KEY	MESSAGE	PUBLIC-KEY	697	3	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
530	MESSAGE%PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION	MESSAGE	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	692	1	Some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.	One of the more fascinating topics in the field of encryption is public-key encryption, which involves techniques by which encryption systems are designed so that having knowledge about how messages are encrypted does not allow one to decrypt messages.	This characteristic is somewhat counterintuitive.
531	MESSAGE%REPEATER	MESSAGE	REPEATER	80	1	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.	Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side.
532	MESSAGE%ROUTER	MESSAGE	ROUTER	97	4	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
533	MESSAGE%ROUTER	MESSAGE	ROUTER	101	4	When a machine in one of the wifi networks wants to send a message to a machine in the ethernet network, it first sends the message to the access point in its network.	From there, the access point sends the message to its associated router, and this router forwards the message to the router at the Ethernet.	There the message is given to a machine on the bus, and that machine then forwards the message to its final destination in the Ethernet.
534	MESSAGE%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	MESSAGE	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	3	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
535	MESSAGE%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	MESSAGE	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	298	3	Other protocols come into play for other aspects of transporting email.	Because simple mail transfer protocol was initially designed for transferring text messages encoded with ASCII, additional protocols such as multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) have been developed to convert non-ASCII data to simple mail transfer protocol compatible form.	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.
536	MESSAGE%SWITCH	MESSAGE	SWITCH	86	1	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).	As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for other spokes.	Moreover, each message that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.
537	MESSAGE%TRANSPORT_LAYER	MESSAGE	TRANSPORT LAYER	511	3	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
538	MESSAGE%TRANSPORT_LAYER	MESSAGE	TRANSPORT LAYER	514	3	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.	Toward this latter goal, the transport layer divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet as individual units.
539	METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	166	3	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
540	METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	3	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
541	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_SERVICE	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	ADDRESS TRANSLATION SERVICE	245	1	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
542	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%APPLICATION_LAYER	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	APPLICATION LAYER	513	2	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.
543	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%NAME_SERVER	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	NAME SERVER	245	2	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
544	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	5	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
545	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	365	5	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.
546	MNEMONIC_DOMAIN_NAME%NAME_SERVER	MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME	NAME SERVER	248	2	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.	Thus, for a machine to be accessible by means of a mnemonic domain name, that name must be represented in a name server within the domain name system.	In those cases in which the entity establishing the domain has the resources, it can establish and maintain its own name server containing all the names within that domain.
547	MULTICAST%IPV6	MULTICAST	IPV6	591	1	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.	To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of internet protocol known as IPv6 (internet protocol version six), which uses internet addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.	The process of converting from internet protocol version four to internet protocol version six is currently underway-this is the conversion that was alluded to in our introduction of Internet addresses in Section 4.2-and it is expected that the use of 32-bit addresses within the Internet will be extinct by 2025.
548	MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION%LINK_LAYER	MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
549	NAME_SERVER%APPLICATION_LAYER	NAME SERVER	APPLICATION LAYER	513	2	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.

The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.

A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.

554	NETWORK_CLASSIFICATIONS%PROPRIETARY_,_NETWORK	NETWORK CLASSIFICATIONS	PROPRIETARY , NETWORK	16	1	Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.	A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.
555	NETWORK_CLASSIFICATIONS%TOPOLOGY_OF_THE_NETWORK	NETWORK CLASSIFICATIONS	TOPOLOGY OF THE NETWORK	22	1	In contrast, a company such as Novell Inc. might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing these products.	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).

557	NETWORK_LAYER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	NETWORK LAYER	INTERNET PROTOCOL	580	2	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
558	NETWORK_LAYER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
559	NETWORK_LAYER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_VERSION_FOUR	NETWORK LAYER	INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION FOUR	589	1	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.
560	NETWORK_LAYER%IPV4	NETWORK LAYER	IPV4	589	2	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.

However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.
561	NETWORK_LAYER%LINK_LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	LINK LAYER	527	1	Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.	Having determined the proper direction, the network layer hands the packet to the link layer for actual transmission.	The link layer has the responsibility of transferring the packet.
562	NETWORK_OF_NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK OF NETWORK	INTERNET	93	1	In these cases the networks must be connected in a manner that builds a network of networks, known as an internet, in which the original networks maintain their individuality and continue to function as autonomous networks.	Note that the generic term internet is distinct from the Internet.	The Internet, written with an uppercase I, refers to a particular, worldwide internet that we will study in later sections of this chapter.
563	NETWORK_PROTOCOL%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	NETWORK PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	272	2	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.

565	NETWORK_PROTOCOL%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK PROTOCOL	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	2	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
566	NETWORK_PROTOCOL%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK PROTOCOL	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	264	2	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.

These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.

In the United States this problem is addressed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.	It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.

In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
578	NETWORK%3G	NETWORK	3G	334	1	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.
579	NETWORK%4G	NETWORK	4G	323	5	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

580	NETWORK%4G	NETWORK	4G	335	5	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	The Generations of wireless telephones Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.
581	NETWORK%ACCESS_POINT	NETWORK	ACCESS POINT	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
582	NETWORK%ADDRESS	NETWORK	ADDRESS	104	1	The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward messages in their proper directions.	This forwarding process is based on an internetwide addressing system in which all the devices in an internet (including the machines in the original networks and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.	Thus, each machine in one of the original networks has two addresses: its original " local " address within its own network and its internet address.
583	NETWORK%ANALOG_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE	NETWORK	ANALOG NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE	207	1	Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.	Modern networks can be designed to carry digital data directly between computers, but older, analog network infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the Internet.	Issues arising from these legacy analog linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.
584	NETWORK%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	3	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
585	NETWORK%ANYCAST	NETWORK	ANYCAST	346	1	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.	Internet streaming of high-definition, on-demand video has permeated far more than traditional PCs.
586	NETWORK%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	2	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.
587	NETWORK%BRIDGE	NETWORK	BRIDGE	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
588	NETWORK%BUS	NETWORK	BUS	23	3	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
589	NETWORK%BUS_NETWORK	NETWORK	BUS NETWORK	29	2	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.	The distinction is whether the machines in the network envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central machine.
590	NETWORK%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	NETWORK	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
591	NETWORK%CLOUD_COMPUTING	NETWORK	CLOUD COMPUTING	160	2	Enabled by the growing connectivity of the Internet, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home PCs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.	Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.
592	NETWORK%CLUSTER_COMPUTE	NETWORK	CLUSTER COMPUTE	152	1	Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.
593	NETWORK%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	NETWORK	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	2	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
594	NETWORK%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	NETWORK	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	58	2	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.
595	NETWORK%COMPUTER_NETWORK	NETWORK	COMPUTER NETWORK	9	1	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
596	NETWORK%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	NETWORK	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	3	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
597	NETWORK%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	NETWORK	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	345	3	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.
598	NETWORK%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE	NETWORK	DENIAL OF SERVICE	630	1	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
599	NETWORK%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	NETWORK	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	2	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
600	NETWORK%END_SYSTEM	NETWORK	END SYSTEM	191	1	After all, the Internet is essentially a communications system, and thus any device that would benefit from communicating with other devices is a potential end system.	The technology by which end systems connect to larger networks is also varied.	Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.
601	NETWORK%ETHERNET_NETWORK	NETWORK	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	3	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
602	NETWORK%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	2	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
603	NETWORK%FIREWALL	NETWORK	FIREWALL	644	4	The old adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections.	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.
604	NETWORK%FIREWALL	NETWORK	FIREWALL	650	4	Masquerading as a party other than one's self is known as spoofing.	Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains.	For example, if a computer is not being used as a webserver, a name server, or an email server, then a firewall should be installed at that computer to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.
605	NETWORK%FIREWALL	NETWORK	FIREWALL	672	4	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
606	NETWORK%FORWARDING_TABLE	NETWORK	FORWARDING TABLE	108	1	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
607	NETWORK%GATEWAY	NETWORK	GATEWAY	109	4	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.
608	NETWORK%GATEWAY	NETWORK	GATEWAY	113	4	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.	Methods of Process Communication
609	NETWORK%HOT_SPOT	NETWORK	HOT SPOT	194	1	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.	The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.	Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.
610	NETWORK%HUB	NETWORK	HUB	33	1	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
611	NETWORK%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	264	1	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
612	NETWORK%INSTANT_MESSAGING	NETWORK	INSTANT MESSAGING	266	1	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.
613	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	18	5	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.
614	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	93	5	In these cases the networks must be connected in a manner that builds a network of networks, known as an internet, in which the original networks maintain their individuality and continue to function as autonomous networks.	Note that the generic term internet is distinct from the Internet.	The Internet, written with an uppercase I, refers to a particular, worldwide internet that we will study in later sections of this chapter.
615	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	166	5	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
616	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	169	5	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
617	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	171	5	Internet Architecture	As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.	In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).
618	NETWORK%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	NETWORK	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	342	1	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.
619	NETWORK%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER	NETWORK	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	586	1	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.	Each time an internet protocol network layer forwards a packet, it decrements that packet's hop count by one.	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.
620	NETWORK%INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	NETWORK	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	172	3	As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.	In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).	It is also customary to use the term internet service provider in reference to the networks themselves.
621	NETWORK%LINK_LAYER	NETWORK	LINK LAYER	531	1	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.
622	NETWORK%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
623	NETWORK%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	9	5	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
624	NETWORK%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	1	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
625	NETWORK%METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
626	NETWORK%METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	9	5	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
627	NETWORK%METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	13	5	For example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a local area network.	A metropolitan area network is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.	Finally, a wide area network links machines over a greater distance-perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.
628	NETWORK%NAME_SERVER	NETWORK	NAME SERVER	256	1	However, many individuals or small organizations want to establish a domain presence on the Internet without committing the resources necessary to support it.	For example, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the Internet as KingsandQueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its own network, maintain a link from this network to the Internet, and implement its own name server.	In this case, the club can contract with an access internet service provider to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the internet service provider.
629	NETWORK%NETWORK_LAYER	NETWORK	NETWORK LAYER	502	1	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
630	NETWORK%NETWORK_NEWS_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK	NETWORK NEWS TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

632	NETWORK%NETWORK_SECURITY	NETWORK	NETWORK SECURITY	284	1	Modern mail servers must use extended versions of simple mail transfer protocol or their equivalent to help ensure that email is transmitted securely.	We discuss concerns about network security in greater detail in the final segment of this chapter.	Returning to the transcript, in line 4 the sending server announces that it has a mail message to deliver, and identifies the sending user.
633	NETWORK%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	NETWORK SOFTWARE	3	3	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.	In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.
634	NETWORK%OPEN_NETWORK	NETWORK	OPEN NETWORK	16	5	Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.	A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.
635	NETWORK%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	NETWORK	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	1	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
636	NETWORK%PERSONAL_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	PERSONAL AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).

A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.
639	NETWORK%PROTOCOL	NETWORK	PROTOCOL	37	1	The result is a network that looks like a star network although it operates like a bus network.	Protocols For a network to function reliably, it is important to establish rules by which activities are conducted.	Such rules are called protocols.
640	NETWORK%PROTOCOL	NETWORK	PROTOCOL	41	2	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.	As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of messages among computers in a network.	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.
641	NETWORK%PROTOCOL_STANDARD	NETWORK	PROTOCOL STANDARD	39	1	Such rules are called protocols.	By developing and adopting protocol standards, vendors are able to build products for network applications that are compatible with products from other vendors.	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.
642	NETWORK%PROXY_SERVER	NETWORK	PROXY SERVER	665	1	Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a server of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the proxy server.	In turn, the proxy server, playing the role of a client, contacts the actual server.	From then on the proxy server plays the role of an intermediary between the actual client and the actual server by relaying messages back and forth.
643	NETWORK%REPEATER	NETWORK	REPEATER	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
644	NETWORK%ROUTER	NETWORK	ROUTER	97	4	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
645	NETWORK%SECURE_SHELL	NETWORK	SECURE SHELL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
646	NETWORK%SERVER	NETWORK	SERVER	117	2	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
647	NETWORK%SERVER	NETWORK	SERVER	121	2	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.	In this case the printer played the role of a server (often called a print server), and the other machines were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the print server.	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.
648	NETWORK%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	269	1	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.
649	NETWORK%STAR	NETWORK	STAR	23	3	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
650	NETWORK%STAR	NETWORK	STAR	25	3	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.
651	NETWORK%STAR_NETWORK	NETWORK	STAR NETWORK	27	3	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.
652	NETWORK%SWITCH	NETWORK	SWITCH	77	2	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).

654	NETWORK%SWITCH	NETWORK	SWITCH	85	3	A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).	As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for other spokes.
655	NETWORK%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	NETWORK	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	1	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.

657	NETWORK%TOPOLOGY_OF_THE_NETWORK	NETWORK	TOPOLOGY OF THE NETWORK	22	1	In contrast, a company such as Novell Inc. might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing these products.	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).
658	NETWORK%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	NETWORK	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.

Finally, the current generation of smartphones use wireless voice over internet protocol technology.	That is, earlier generations of wireless phones only communicated with the telephone company's network using that company's protocols.
660	NETWORK%WIDE_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIDE AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.

A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
662	NETWORK%WIFI_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIFI NETWORK	69	3	After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or busy channel requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.	To solve this problem, some wifi networks require that each machine send a short " request " message to the access point and wait until the access point acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire message.	If the access point is busy because it is dealing with a " hidden terminal ", it will ignore the request, and the requesting machine will know to wait.
663	NETWORK%WIRELESS_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIRELESS NETWORK	28	2	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
664	NETWORK%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	NETWORK	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	1	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
665	NETWORK%WORM	NETWORK	WORM	610	3	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.
666	NETWORK%WORM	NETWORK	WORM	612	3	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.
667	NETWORKING_SYSTEM%ETHERNET_NETWORK	NETWORKING SYSTEM	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	1	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
668	NETWORKING_TECHNOLOGY%ANYCAST	NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY	ANYCAST	346	1	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.	Internet streaming of high-definition, on-demand video has permeated far more than traditional PCs.
669	NOTATIONAL_SYSTEM%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	NOTATIONAL SYSTEM	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	430	2	This same style could also be used to develop systems for representing other formats such as mathematical expressions and graphics.	The extensible markup language (XML) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music example) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.
670	NOTATIONAL_SYSTEM%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	NOTATIONAL SYSTEM	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	417	2	extensible markup language	hypertext markup language is essentially a notational system by which a text document along with the document's appearance can be encoded as a simple text file.	In a similar manner we can also encode nontextual material as text files-an example being sheet music.
671	NOTATIONAL_SYSTEM%MARKUP_LANGUAGE	NOTATIONAL SYSTEM	MARKUP LANGUAGE	432	2	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.
672	OPEN_NETWORK%INTERNET	OPEN NETWORK	INTERNET	18	3	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.
673	OPEN_NETWORK%OPEN_SYSTEM_INTERCONNECTION	OPEN NETWORK	OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION	557	1	The demand for open networks has generated a need for published standards by which manufacturers can supply equipment and software that function properly with products from other vendors.	One standard that has resulted is the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model, produced by the International Organization for Standardization.	This standard is based on a seven-level hierarchy as opposed to the four-level hierarchy we have just described.

676	OPERATING_SYSTEM%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	OPERATING SYSTEM	NETWORK SOFTWARE	4	1	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.	In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.	In this chapter we will explore this expanding field of computer science.
677	PACKET%HOP_COUNT	PACKET	HOP COUNT	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
678	PACKET%LINK_LAYER	PACKET	LINK LAYER	525	1	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.	Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.
679	PACKET%NETWORK_LAYER	PACKET	NETWORK LAYER	519	1	The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message's destination.	Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.	From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they reach the transport layer at their final destination.
680	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%FILE_DISTRIBUTION	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	FILE DISTRIBUTION	135	1	The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).	One reason that the peer-to-peer model is replacing the client/server model for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one server.
681	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%FILE_SHARING	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	FILE SHARING	136	1	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).	One reason that the peer-to-peer model is replacing the client/server model for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one server.	This lack of a centralized base of operation leads to a more efficient system.
682	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%INSTANT_MESSAGING	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	INSTANT MESSAGING	131	1	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.	The peer-to-peer model is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the Internet.
683	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%SWARM	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	SWARM	134	1	In this case, one peer may receive a file from another and then provide that file to other peers.	The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.	The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the client/server model by establishing a central distribution center (the server) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).
684	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	307	3	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.	However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking voice over internet protocol with traditional telephone systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond traditional Internet applications.
685	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	311	3	Existing voice over internet protocol systems come in four different forms that are competing for popularity.	Voice over internet protocol soft phones consist of peer-to-peer software that allows two or more PCs to share a call with no more special hardware than a speaker and a microphone.	An example of a voice over internet protocol soft phone system is Skype, which also provides its clients with links to the traditional telephone communication system.

687	PERSONAL_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	PERSONAL AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	166	3	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
688	PERSONAL_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	PERSONAL AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	3	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.

689	PHISHING%SPAM	PHISHING	SPAM	641	2	Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam.	This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating trojan horses that might spread viruses and other detrimental software.

690	PHONE_NETWORK%1G	PHONE NETWORK	1G	332	1	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
691	PHONE_NETWORK%3G	PHONE NETWORK	3G	334	3	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.
692	PHONE_NETWORK%4G	PHONE NETWORK	4G	323	1	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

693	PHONE_NETWORK%4G	PHONE NETWORK	4G	335	2	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	The Generations of wireless telephones Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.

698	PHONE_TECHNOLOGY%SMARTPHONES	PHONE TECHNOLOGY	SMARTPHONES	330	1	Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.	An entirely new wave of phone technology has emerged roughly every 10 years since that time, leading up to our current complex, multifunction smartphones.	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.
699	PORT_NUMBER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_SERVER	PORT NUMBER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER	547	1	Users of the Internet rarely need to be concerned with port numbers because the common applications have universally accepted port numbers.	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.
700	PORT_NUMBER%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PORT NUMBER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	548	1	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.	In summary, communication over the Internet involves the interaction of four layers of software.
701	PORT_NUMBER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	PORT NUMBER	TRANSPORT LAYER	543	2	Once the message is assembled, the transport layer hands it to the appropriate unit within the application layer-thus completing the message transmission process.	Determining which unit within the application layer should receive an incoming message is an important task of the transport layer.	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.
702	PREVENTATIVE_TOOL%PROXY_SERVER	PREVENTATIVE TOOL	PROXY SERVER	659	1	These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.
703	PRIVATE-KEY%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	PRIVATE-KEY	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	716	4	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
704	PROCESS%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	PROCESS	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	143	1	It is not a property of the network (or internet).	A process might use the peer-to-peer model to communicate with another process and later use the client/server model to communicate with another process over the same network.	Thus, it would be more accurate to speak of communicating by means of the peer-to-peer model rather than communicating over a peer-to-peer network.
705	PROCESS%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	PROCESS	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	2	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
706	PROCESS%INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION	PROCESS	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	116	2	The various activities (or processes) executing on the different computers within a network (or even executing on the same machine via time-sharing/multitasking) must often communicate with each other to coordinate their actions and to perform their designated tasks.	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.
707	PROCESS%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	PROCESS	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	143	1	It is not a property of the network (or internet).	A process might use the peer-to-peer model to communicate with another process and later use the client/server model to communicate with another process over the same network.	Thus, it would be more accurate to speak of communicating by means of the peer-to-peer model rather than communicating over a peer-to-peer network.
708	PROGRAM%APPLET	PROGRAM	APPLET	471	2	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.	Another approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to first transfer a webpage to a browser and then transfer additional program units called applets (written in the language Java) to the browser as requested within the hypertext markup language source document.	Still another approach is the system Flash (developed by Macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.
709	PROGRAM%FIREWALL	PROGRAM	FIREWALL	644	2	The old adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections.	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.
710	PROGRAM%INTERNET_APPLICATIONS	PROGRAM	INTERNET APPLICATIONS	261	1	In this way, many registered domains can reside within a single internet service provider, each often occupying only a small portion of a single computer.	Internet Applications	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.
711	PROGRAM%JAVASCRIPT	PROGRAM	JAVASCRIPT	469	1	There are numerous systems for performing client - and server-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.	An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language JavaScript (developed by Netscape Communications, Inc.) within the hypertext markup language source document for the webpage.	From there a browser can extract the programs and follow them as needed.
712	PROGRAM%SERVLETS	PROGRAM	SERVLETS	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
713	PROGRAM%TROJAN_HORSE	PROGRAM	TROJAN HORSE	613	2	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.

A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.

A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.

The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.

The world wide web consortium The world wide web consortium (W3C) was formed in 1994 to promote the world wide web by developing protocol standards (known as world wide web consortium standards). world wide web consortium is headquartered at CERN, the high-energy particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.	CERN is where the original hypertext markup language markup language was developed as well as the hypertext transfer protocol protocol for transferring hypertext markup language documents over the Internet.
718	PROTOCOL%CARRIER_SENSE	PROTOCOL	CARRIER SENSE	43	3	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
719	PROTOCOL%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	PROTOCOL	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
720	PROTOCOL%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	PROTOCOL	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	2	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.

We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.
722	PROTOCOL%ETHERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	ETHERNET PROTOCOL	76	1	This can be done by connecting the networks to form a larger version of the same " type " of network.	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.
723	PROTOCOL%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
724	PROTOCOL%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	4	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).

CERN is where the original hypertext markup language markup language was developed as well as the hypertext transfer protocol protocol for transferring hypertext markup language documents over the Internet.	Today world wide web consortium is the source of many standards (including standards for extensible markup language and numerous multimedia applications) that lead to compatibility over a wide range of Internet products.

When the browser finds this tag, it will send a message to the hypertext transfer protocol server at Images. com requesting the image called OurPic.jpg and then display the image appropriately.	If we moved the image tag to the end of the document just before the < / body > tag, then the browser would display the image at the bottom of the webpage.
727	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	3	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
728	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL	216	4	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).
729	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL	561	4	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
730	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL	580	4	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
731	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	1	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
732	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	342	1	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.
733	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_LAYER	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK LAYER	586	1	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.	Each time an internet protocol network layer forwards a packet, it decrements that packet's hop count by one.	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.
734	PROTOCOL%MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	PROTOCOL	MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	2	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.

735	PROTOCOL%NAME_SERVER	PROTOCOL	NAME SERVER	245	1	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).

Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.

739	PROTOCOL%PROTOCOL_STANDARD	PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL STANDARD	39	2	Such rules are called protocols.	By developing and adopting protocol standards, vendors are able to build products for network applications that are compatible with products from other vendors.	Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of networking technologies.
740	PROTOCOL%SECURE_SHELL	PROTOCOL	SECURE SHELL	263	1	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.

741	PROTOCOL%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	PROTOCOL	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
742	PROTOCOL%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	1	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
743	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	561	3	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
744	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
745	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	560	2	It is an often-quoted model because it carries the authority of an international organization, but it has been slow to replace the four-level point of view, mainly because it was established after the four-level hierarchy had already become the de facto standard for the Internet.

746	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_SYSTEM	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL SYSTEM	322	1	That is, earlier generations of wireless phones only communicated with the telephone company's network using that company's protocols.	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.
747	PROTOCOL%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	PROTOCOL	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	3	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
748	PROTOCOL%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	PROTOCOL	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	365	3	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.
749	PROTOCOL%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	563	2	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.
750	PROTOCOL%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	307	1	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.	However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking voice over internet protocol with traditional telephone systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond traditional Internet applications.
751	PROTOCOL%WIFI	PROTOCOL	WIFI	57	1	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
752	PROTOCOL%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	PROTOCOL	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	1	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.

CERN is where the original hypertext markup language markup language was developed as well as the hypertext transfer protocol protocol for transferring hypertext markup language documents over the Internet.
754	PROXY_SERVER%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_PROXY_SERVER	PROXY SERVER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL PROXY SERVER	670	2	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).
755	PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION_SYSTEM%PRIVATE-KEY	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM	PRIVATE-KEY	697	2	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.

757	PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION%PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION_SYSTEM	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM	695	2	After all, intuition would suggest that if a person knows how messages are encrypted, then that person should be able to reverse the encryption process and thus decrypt messages.	But public-key encryption systems defy this intuitive logic.	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.
758	PUBLIC-KEY%CERTIFICATE	PUBLIC-KEY	CERTIFICATE	710	3	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.
759	PUBLIC-KEY%CERTIFICATE	PUBLIC-KEY	CERTIFICATE	711	3	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.	Many commercial certificate authorities are now available on the Internet, although it is also common for organizations to maintain their own certificate authorities in order to maintain tighter control over the security of the organization's communication.
760	PUBLIC-KEY%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	PUBLIC-KEY	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	3	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
761	PUBLIC-KEY%PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION	PUBLIC-KEY	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	722	1	The message that is revealed is guaranteed to be authentic because only the holder of the private-key could have produced the encrypted version.	We will return to the topic of public-key encryption at the end of Chapter 12, as an example of a complex computer algorithm.	Legal Approaches to Network Security

763	REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	REMOTE MAIL SERVER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	275	1	Similarly, when the server process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.	The transcript of their simple mail transfer protocol exchange might look something like this: In line 1, the remote mail server process answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.
764	REPEATER%BRIDGE	REPEATER	BRIDGE	79	3	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.
765	REPEATER%ROUTER	REPEATER	ROUTER	98	3	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
766	ROUTER%ADDRESS	ROUTER	ADDRESS	106	1	Thus, each machine in one of the original networks has two addresses: its original " local " address within its own network and its internet address.	A machine wanting to send a message to a machine in a distant network attaches the internet address of the destination to the message and directs the message to its local router.	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.
767	ROUTER%FORWARDING_TABLE	ROUTER	FORWARDING TABLE	108	4	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
768	ROUTER%GATEWAY	ROUTER	GATEWAY	111	5	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.	In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.
769	ROUTER%GATEWAY	ROUTER	GATEWAY	112	5	In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.
770	ROUTER%HOP_COUNT	ROUTER	HOP COUNT	588	2	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.
771	ROUTER%HOT_SPOT	ROUTER	HOT SPOT	205	2	These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an end system or to a customer's router to which multiple end systems are connected.	This latter tactic is popular for individual residences where a local hot spot is created by a router / access point connected to an access internet service provider by means of existing cable or telephone lines.	Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.
772	ROUTER%LINK_LAYER	ROUTER	LINK LAYER	523	3	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
773	ROUTER%LINK_LAYER	ROUTER	LINK LAYER	525	3	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.	Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.
774	ROUTER%NETWORK_LAYER	ROUTER	NETWORK LAYER	523	5	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
775	ROUTER%NETWORK_LAYER	ROUTER	NETWORK LAYER	524	5	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.

The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.
776	ROUTER%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	ROUTER	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	1	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.
777	ROUTER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	ROUTER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	4	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.
778	ROUTER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	ROUTER	TRANSPORT LAYER	515	2	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.	Toward this latter goal, the transport layer divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet as individual units.	This division is necessary because a single long message can obstruct the flow of other messages at the Internet routers where numerous messages cross paths.
779	ROUTER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	ROUTER	TRANSPORT LAYER	516	2	Toward this latter goal, the transport layer divides long messages into small segments, which are transmitted over the Internet as individual units.	This division is necessary because a single long message can obstruct the flow of other messages at the Internet routers where numerous messages cross paths.	Indeed, small segments of messages can interweave at these points, whereas a long message forces others to wait while it passes (much like cars waiting for a long train to pass at a railroad crossing).
780	SEARCH_ENGINE%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	SEARCH ENGINE	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	463	1	Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.	In this case a user at the client specifies a topic of interest (a client-side activity), which is then transferred to the search engine where a customized webpage identifying documents of possible interest is constructed (a server-side activity) and sent back to the client.	Still another example occurs in the case of Web mail-an increasingly popular means by which computer users are able to access their email by means of Web browsers.
781	SECURE_SHELL%APPLICATION_LAYER	SECURE SHELL	APPLICATION LAYER	508	1	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
782	SECURITY%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	SECURITY	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	1	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.
783	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED_TAG%SEARCH_ENGINE	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED TAG	SEARCH ENGINE	444	1	The difference is subtle but important.	The semantic approach would allow search engines (websites that assist users in locating Web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".
784	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED_TAG%WORLD_WIDE_SEMANTIC_WEB	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED TAG	WORLD WIDE SEMANTIC WEB	446	1	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".	In turn, by using an Internet-wide standard for marking documents according to semantics rather than appearance, a World Wide Semantic Web, rather than the World Wide Syntactic Web we have today, would be created.	Client-Side and Server-Side Activities
785	SEMANTICS%SEMANTIC-ORIENTED_TAG	SEMANTICS	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED TAG	442	1	For example, with hypertext markup language the ingredients in a recipe can be marked so that they appear as a list in which each ingredient is positioned on a separate line.	But if we used semantic-oriented tags, ingredients in a recipe could be marked as ingredients (perhaps using the tags < ingredient > and < / ingredient >) rather than merely items in a list.	The difference is subtle but important.
786	SERVER_PROCESS%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	SERVER PROCESS	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	2	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
787	SERVER_SIDE%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	SERVER SIDE	INTERNET PROTOCOL	484	1	If the server blindly executes any program sent to it by a client, security breaches and potential damage at the server could result.	4.4 internet protocols	In this section we investigate how messages are transferred over the Internet.
788	SERVER_SIDE%PHP	SERVER SIDE	PHP	478	2	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.	Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and servers to execute programs on the other's machine.
789	SERVER_SIDE%SERVLET	SERVER SIDE	SERVLET	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
790	SERVER_SIDE%SERVLETS	SERVER SIDE	SERVLETS	474	2	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
791	SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY%ACTIVE_SERVER_PAGE	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	ACTIVE SERVER PAGE	477	2	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.
792	SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY%COMMON_GATEWAY_INTERFACE	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE	473	2	Still another approach is the system Flash (developed by Macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.
793	SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY%JAVASERVER_PAGE	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	3	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
794	SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY%PHP	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	PHP	478	2	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.	Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and servers to execute programs on the other's machine.
795	SERVER%ANYCAST	SERVER	ANYCAST	346	1	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.	Internet streaming of high-definition, on-demand video has permeated far more than traditional PCs.
796	SERVER%APPLICATION_LAYER	SERVER	APPLICATION LAYER	508	5	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
797	SERVER%CLIENT-SIDE_ACTIVITY	SERVER	CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
798	SERVER%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	3	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
799	SERVER%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	129	3	Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model.	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.
800	SERVER%COMMON_GATEWAY_INTERFACE	SERVER	COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE	473	1	Still another approach is the system Flash (developed by Macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.
801	SERVER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	SERVER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	4	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
802	SERVER%FILE_SERVER	SERVER	FILE SERVER	125	4	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
803	SERVER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	SERVER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
804	SERVER%MAIL_SERVER	SERVER	MAIL SERVER	270	4	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
805	SERVER%NAME_SERVER	SERVER	NAME SERVER	245	5	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
806	SERVER%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	SERVER	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	2	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
807	SERVER%PRINT_SERVER	SERVER	PRINT SERVER	121	5	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.	In this case the printer played the role of a server (often called a print server), and the other machines were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the print server.	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.
808	SERVER%PROXY_SERVER	SERVER	PROXY SERVER	659	5	These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.
809	SERVER%PROXY_SERVER	SERVER	PROXY SERVER	660	5	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
810	SERVER%REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER	SERVER	REMOTE MAIL SERVER	282	2	Untold millions of these exchanges occur on the network each day, known only to the software agents that transport email across the Internet.	In the simplest case, the remote mail server will take mail.skaro.gov at its word in line 2, accepting that the sending server is the machine named mail from the domain skaro.gov. simple mail transfer protocol is an example of a protocol originally built on trust that has subsequently been abused by spammers and other Internet miscreants.	Modern mail servers must use extended versions of simple mail transfer protocol or their equivalent to help ensure that email is transmitted securely.
811	SERVER%REMOTE_SERVER	SERVER	REMOTE SERVER	277	1	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.	In line 3, the remote server acknowledges the name of the sending server.	Most internet protocols are not necessarily transmitted in ASCII characters so easily interpreted by a human.
812	SERVER%SERVER_PROCESS	SERVER	SERVER PROCESS	274	1	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.	Similarly, when the server process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.	The transcript of their simple mail transfer protocol exchange might look something like this: In line 1, the remote mail server process answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.
813	SERVER%SERVER_SIDE	SERVER	SERVER SIDE	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
814	SERVER%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	SERVER	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	5	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
815	SERVER%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	SERVER	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	461	5	On the basis of this information, the customer would specify the destinations of interest and desired dates of travel (a client-side activity).	This information would then be transferred back to the agent's server where it would be used to construct the appropriate customized webpage (a server-side activity), which would then be sent to the customer's browser.	Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.
816	SERVER%SERVLET	SERVER	SERVLET	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
817	SERVER%SPYWARE	SERVER	SPYWARE	653	1	Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a computer is by establishing contact through a " hole " left by a nonexistent server.	In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine server on the infected computer by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware's findings.	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.
818	SERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	SERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	362	3	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.
819	SERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	SERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	3	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
820	SERVER%WEBSERVER	SERVER	WEBSERVER	481	1	The fact that webservers routinely transfer programs to clients where they are executed leads to ethical questions on the server side and security questions on the client side.	If the client blindly executes any program sent to it by a webserver, it opens itself to malicious activities by the server.	Likewise, the fact that clients can cause programs to be executed at the server leads to ethical questions on the client side and security questions on the server side.
821	SERVER%WEBSERVERS	SERVER	WEBSERVERS	264	2	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
822	SERVLETS%JAVASERVER_PAGE	SERVLETS	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	1	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
823	SHORT_BUS%HUB	SHORT BUS	HUB	34	1	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.	All it does is relay any signal it receives (with perhaps some amplification) back out to all the machines connected to it.
824	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
825	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%MULTIPURPOSE_INTERNET_MAIL_EXTENSION	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	MULTIPURPOSE INTERNET MAIL EXTENSION	298	2	Other protocols come into play for other aspects of transporting email.	Because simple mail transfer protocol was initially designed for transferring text messages encoded with ASCII, additional protocols such as multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) have been developed to convert non-ASCII data to simple mail transfer protocol compatible form.	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.
826	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
827	SMARTPHONES%4G	SMARTPHONES	4G	323	1	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.	Internet Multimedia Streaming
828	SNIFF%PHISHING	SNIFF	PHISHING	623	1	In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.	As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".
829	SOFTWARE%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	5	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
830	SOFTWARE%APPLICATION_LAYER	SOFTWARE	APPLICATION LAYER	502	3	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
831	SOFTWARE%APPLICATION_LAYER	SOFTWARE	APPLICATION LAYER	508	4	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
832	SOFTWARE%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	2	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.

833	SOFTWARE%BROWSER	SOFTWARE	BROWSER	355	5	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
834	SOFTWARE%BROWSER	SOFTWARE	BROWSER	356	5	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
835	SOFTWARE%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACK	SOFTWARE	DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK	631	1	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.	To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given.
836	SOFTWARE%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	SOFTWARE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	3	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
837	SOFTWARE%GLOBAL_INFORMATION_RETRIEVAL_SYSTEM	SOFTWARE	GLOBAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM	147	1	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
838	SOFTWARE%GRID_COMPUTE	SOFTWARE	GRID COMPUTE	155	2	Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability-because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable-and load-balancing-because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.	Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.	Grid computing can involve specialized software to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the machines participating in a grid.
839	SOFTWARE%GRID_COMPUTE	SOFTWARE	GRID COMPUTE	156	2	Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.	Grid computing can involve specialized software to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the machines participating in a grid.	Examples include University of Wisconsin's Condor system, or Berkeley's Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).
840	SOFTWARE%INTERNET_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	INTERNET SOFTWARE	501	3	Each level in the hierarchy has representatives at both the origin and the destination, with the representatives at the destination tending to do the reverse of their counterparts at the origin.	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).
841	SOFTWARE%LINK_LAYER	SOFTWARE	LINK LAYER	502	2	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
842	SOFTWARE%LINK_LAYER	SOFTWARE	LINK LAYER	523	2	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
843	SOFTWARE%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	4	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
844	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_LAYER	SOFTWARE	NETWORK LAYER	502	2	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
845	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_LAYER	SOFTWARE	NETWORK LAYER	523	2	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
846	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	NETWORK SOFTWARE	3	5	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.	In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.
847	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	NETWORK SOFTWARE	489	5	The Layered Approach to Internet Software	A principal task of networking software is to provide the infrastructure required for transferring messages from one machine to another.	In the Internet, this message-passing activity is accomplished by means of a hierarchy of software units, which perform tasks analogous to those that would be performed if you were to send a gift in a package from the West Coast of the United States to a friend on the East Coast (Figure 4.12).
848	SOFTWARE%PROXY_SERVER	SOFTWARE	PROXY SERVER	659	5	These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.
849	SOFTWARE%PROXY_SERVER	SOFTWARE	PROXY SERVER	660	5	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
850	SOFTWARE%SKYPE	SOFTWARE	SKYPE	312	1	Voice over internet protocol soft phones consist of peer-to-peer software that allows two or more PCs to share a call with no more special hardware than a speaker and a microphone.	An example of a voice over internet protocol soft phone system is Skype, which also provides its clients with links to the traditional telephone communication system.	One drawback to Skype is that it is a proprietary system, and thus much of its operational structure is not publicly known.
851	SOFTWARE%SNIFF_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	SNIFF SOFTWARE	620	1	Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.	Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.	Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.
852	SOFTWARE%SPYWARE	SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	600	5	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.

855	SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	600	3	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
856	SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	613	3	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.	Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
857	SOFTWARE%VIRUS	SOFTWARE	VIRUS	600	5	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
858	SOFTWARE%VIRUS	SOFTWARE	VIRUS	606	5	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
859	SOFTWARE%WEBSERVERS	SOFTWARE	WEBSERVERS	355	3	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
860	SOFTWARE%WORM	SOFTWARE	WORM	600	3	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
861	SOFTWARE%WORM	SOFTWARE	WORM	611	3	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.
862	SPAM%SPAM_FILTER	SPAM	SPAM FILTER	655	2	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.	Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes-an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.	Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.
863	SPOOFING%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	SPOOFING	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	1	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
864	SPYWARE%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	675	2	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.	For example, whereas many products specialize in virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.
865	SPYWARE%PHISHING	SPYWARE	PHISHING	623	1	In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.	As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".
866	STANDARD%ETHERNET	STANDARD	ETHERNET	24	1	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
867	STANDARD%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	STANDARD	INTERNET PROTOCOL	580	1	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
868	STANDARD%OPEN_SYSTEM_INTERCONNECTION	STANDARD	OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION	557	1	The demand for open networks has generated a need for published standards by which manufacturers can supply equipment and software that function properly with products from other vendors.	One standard that has resulted is the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model, produced by the International Organization for Standardization.	This standard is based on a seven-level hierarchy as opposed to the four-level hierarchy we have just described.
869	STANDARD%STANDARD_GENERALIZED_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	STANDARD	STANDARD GENERALIZED MARKUP LANGUAGE	431	1	The extensible markup language (XML) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music example) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.
870	STANDARD%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE	STANDARD	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	19	1	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.	Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.
871	STAR_NETWORK%CENTRAL_ACCESS_POINT	STAR NETWORK	CENTRAL ACCESS POINT	52	1	You go first ", whereas under the carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection protocol each machine merely tries again later.	Note that carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection is not compatible with wireless star networks in which all machines communicate through a central access point.	This is because a machine may be unable to detect that its transmissions are colliding with those of another.
872	STAR_NETWORK%ROUTER	STAR NETWORK	ROUTER	99	1	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.	When a machine in one of the wifi networks wants to send a message to a machine in the ethernet network, it first sends the message to the access point in its network.
873	STAR_NETWORK%WIRELESS_NETWORK	STAR NETWORK	WIRELESS NETWORK	28	2	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
874	STAR%ACCESS_POINT	STAR	ACCESS POINT	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
875	STAR%STAR_NETWORK	STAR	STAR NETWORK	27	2	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.
876	STAR%STAR_NETWORK	STAR	STAR NETWORK	29	3	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.	The distinction is whether the machines in the network envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central machine.
877	STAR%WIRELESS	STAR	WIRELESS	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.

The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
879	STORAGE%MAGNETIC_DISK	STORAGE	MAGNETIC DISK	123	1	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.
880	STREAMING%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	STREAMING	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	1	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
881	SWITCH%ROUTER	SWITCH	ROUTER	98	3	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
882	SYSTEM%ASCII	SYSTEM	ASCII	376	1	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.
883	SYSTEM%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	SYSTEM	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	3	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
884	SYSTEM%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	SYSTEM	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	246	2	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.
885	TAG%ANCHOR	TAG	ANCHOR	402	1	Let us suppose that, when the word here is clicked, we want the browser to retrieve and display the page at the uniform resource locator http://crafty.com/demo.html.	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).
886	TAG%ANCHOR_TAG	TAG	ANCHOR TAG	402	2	Let us suppose that, when the word here is clicked, we want the browser to retrieve and display the page at the uniform resource locator http://crafty.com/demo.html.	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).
887	TAG%BODY	TAG	BODY	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
888	TAG%HEAD	TAG	HEAD	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
889	TAG%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	TAG	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	378	2	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.
890	TAG%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE_SOURCE_DOCUMENT	TAG	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
891	TAG%SEMANTIC-ORIENTED_TAG	TAG	SEMANTIC-ORIENTED TAG	442	2	For example, with hypertext markup language the ingredients in a recipe can be marked so that they appear as a list in which each ingredient is positioned on a separate line.	But if we used semantic-oriented tags, ingredients in a recipe could be marked as ingredients (perhaps using the tags < ingredient > and < / ingredient >) rather than merely items in a list.	The difference is subtle but important.
892	TEXT_FILE%ASCII	TEXT FILE	ASCII	376	1	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.
893	TEXT_FILE%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	TEXT FILE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	430	1	This same style could also be used to develop systems for representing other formats such as mathematical expressions and graphics.	The extensible markup language (XML) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music example) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.	Actually, extensible markup language is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the Standard Generalized Markup Language, better known as SGML.
894	TEXT_FILE%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	TEXT FILE	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	376	2	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.
895	TEXT_FILE%UNICODE	TEXT FILE	UNICODE	376	1	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.

896	TEXT_MESSAGING%SECOND_GENERATION	TEXT MESSAGING	SECOND GENERATION	333	1	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.
897	THEFT_OF_INFORMATION%COMPUTER_FRAUD_AND_ABUSE_ACT	THEFT OF INFORMATION	COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT	738	1	In short, the act requires proof that the defendant knowingly caused the transmission of a program or data that intentionally caused damage.	The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act also covers cases involving the theft of information.	In particular, the act outlaws obtaining anything of value via the unauthorized access of a computer.
898	TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	180	4	An example would be a company that originated as a traditional telephone company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.
899	TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	185	1	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.
900	TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	185	1	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.
901	TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	186	1	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
902	TOP-LEVEL_DOMAINS%COUNTRY-CODE_TOP-LEVEL_DOMAINS	TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS	COUNTRY-CODE TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS	235	1	Other Top-Level Domains include com for commercial institutions, gov for U.S. government institutions, org for nonprofit organizations, museum for museums, info for unrestricted use, and net, which was originally intended for internet service providers but is now used on a much broader scale.	In addition to these general Top-Level Domains, there are also two-letter Top-Level Domains for specific countries (called country-code Top-Level Domains) such as au for Australia and ca for Canada.	Once a domain's mnemonic name is registered, the organization that registered the name is free to extend the name to obtain mnemonic identifiers for individual items within the domain.
903	TOP-LEVEL_DOMAINS%SUBDOMAIN	TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS	SUBDOMAIN	241	1	These subdomains often represent different networks within the domain's jurisdiction.	For example, if Yoyodyne Corporation was assigned the domain name yoyodyne.com, then an individual computer at Yoyodyne might have a name such as overthruster.propulsion.yoyodyne.com, meaning that the computer overthruster is in the subdomain propulsion within the domain yoyodyne within the Top-Level Domain com.	We should emphasize that the dotted notation used in mnemonic addresses is not related to the dotted decimal notation used to represent addresses in bit pattern form.
904	TOPOLOGY_OF_THE_NETWORK%BUS	TOPOLOGY OF THE NETWORK	BUS	23	1	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
905	TOPOLOGY_OF_THE_NETWORK%STAR	TOPOLOGY OF THE NETWORK	STAR	25	1	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.
906	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%1G	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	1G	332	2	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
907	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%1G	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	1G	339	2	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
908	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%ANALOG_TELEPHONE_ADAPTER	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	ANALOG TELEPHONE ADAPTER	316	1	For instance, to receive calls, a Skype user must leave his or her PC connected to the Internet and available to the Skype system, which means that some of the PC's resources may be used to support other Skype communications without the PC owner's awareness-a feature that has generated some resistance.	A second form of voice over internet protocol consists of analog telephone adapters, which are devices that allow a user to connect his or her traditional telephone to phone service provided by an access internet service provider.	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.
909	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	2	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
910	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	308	2	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.	However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking voice over internet protocol with traditional telephone systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond traditional Internet applications.	Moreover, governments that own their country's traditional telephone companies view voice over internet protocol as a threat and have either taxed it heavily or outlawed it completely.

The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.

913	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE%INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	INTERNET	19	1	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.	Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.
914	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	INTERNET PROTOCOL	561	1	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
915	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	561	1	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.

More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
916	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	563	2	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.
917	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
918	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL%RELIABLE_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	RELIABLE PROTOCOL	575	2	Another difference between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol is that transmission control protocol transport layers at the origin and destination work together by means of acknowledgments and packet retransmissions to assure that all segments of a message are successfully transferred to the destination.	For this reason transmission control protocol is called a reliable protocol, whereas user datagram protocol, which does not offer such retransmission services, is said to be an unreliable protocol.	Still another distinction between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol is that transmission control protocol provides for both flow control, meaning that a transmission control protocol transport layer at a message's origin can reduce the rate at which it transmits segments to keep from overwhelming its counterpart at the destination, as well as congestion control, meaning that a transmission control protocol transport layer at a message's origin can adjust its transmission rate to alleviate congestion between it and the message's destination.
919	TRANSPORT_LAYER%NETWORK_LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	519	3	The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message's destination.	Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.	From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they reach the transport layer at their final destination.
920	TRANSPORT_LAYER%NETWORK_LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	523	3	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
921	TRANSPORT_LAYER%PACKET	TRANSPORT LAYER	PACKET	519	1	The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message's destination.	Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.	From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they reach the transport layer at their final destination.
922	TRANSPORT_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	TRANSPORT LAYER	PORT NUMBER	544	2	Determining which unit within the application layer should receive an incoming message is an important task of the transport layer.	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.
923	TRANSPORT_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	562	3	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).
924	TRANSPORT_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	565	3	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
925	TRANSPORT_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PROTOCOL_SUITE	TRANSPORT LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE	563	1	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.

928	TROJAN_HORSE%SPAM	TROJAN HORSE	SPAM	641	2	Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam.	This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating trojan horses that might spread viruses and other detrimental software.	Protection and Cures
929	UNICODE%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	UNICODE	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	376	1	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.
930	UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR%ANCHOR	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	ANCHOR	403	1	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).	Having added the anchor tags, the webpage will now appear on a computer screen as shown in Figure 4.10b.
931	UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR%ANCHOR_TAG	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	ANCHOR TAG	403	1	To do so, we must first surround the word here in the source version of the page with the tags < a > and < / a >, which are called anchor tags.	Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in Figure 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the uniform resource locator following the equal sign (http://crafty.com/demo.html).	Having added the anchor tags, the webpage will now appear on a computer screen as shown in Figure 4.10b.
932	UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR%HOME_PAGE	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	HOME PAGE	372	1	Such shortened uniform resource locators provide a simple means of contacting organizations.	For example, the uniform resource locator http://www.google.com will lead to the home page of Google, which contains hyperlinks to the services, products, and documents relating to the company.	To further simplify locating websites, many browsers assume that the hypertext transfer protocol protocol should be used if no protocol is identified.
933	USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL%CONNECTIONLESS_PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	CONNECTIONLESS PROTOCOL	573	2	For all it knows, the destination computer might not even be operational.	For this reason, user datagram protocol is called a connectionless protocol.	Another difference between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol is that transmission control protocol transport layers at the origin and destination work together by means of acknowledgments and packet retransmissions to assure that all segments of a message are successfully transferred to the destination.
934	USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL%UNRELIABLE_PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	UNRELIABLE PROTOCOL	575	2	Another difference between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol is that transmission control protocol transport layers at the origin and destination work together by means of acknowledgments and packet retransmissions to assure that all segments of a message are successfully transferred to the destination.	For this reason transmission control protocol is called a reliable protocol, whereas user datagram protocol, which does not offer such retransmission services, is said to be an unreliable protocol.

935	VIRUS%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	VIRUS	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	3	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
936	VIRUS%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	VIRUS	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	675	3	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.	For example, whereas many products specialize in virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.
937	VIRUS%COMPUTER_FRAUD_AND_ABUSE_ACT	VIRUS	COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT	735	1	We begin with the proliferation of malware.	In the United States this problem is addressed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.	It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.
938	VIRUS%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_PROXY_SERVER	VIRUS	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL PROXY SERVER	670	1	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).
939	VIRUS%PROXY_SERVER	VIRUS	PROXY SERVER	670	1	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.

940	VIRUS%SPAM	VIRUS	SPAM	641	2	Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam.	This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating trojan horses that might spread viruses and other detrimental software.	Protection and Cures
941	VIRUS%WORM	VIRUS	WORM	611	1	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.
942	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%ANALOG_TELEPHONE_ADAPTER	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	ANALOG TELEPHONE ADAPTER	316	2	For instance, to receive calls, a Skype user must leave his or her PC connected to the Internet and available to the Skype system, which means that some of the PC's resources may be used to support other Skype communications without the PC owner's awareness-a feature that has generated some resistance.	A second form of voice over internet protocol consists of analog telephone adapters, which are devices that allow a user to connect his or her traditional telephone to phone service provided by an access internet service provider.	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.
943	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%EMBEDDED_VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL_PHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	EMBEDDED VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE	318	2	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
944	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%SKYPE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	SKYPE	312	2	Voice over internet protocol soft phones consist of peer-to-peer software that allows two or more PCs to share a call with no more special hardware than a speaker and a microphone.	An example of a voice over internet protocol soft phone system is Skype, which also provides its clients with links to the traditional telephone communication system.	One drawback to Skype is that it is a proprietary system, and thus much of its operational structure is not publicly known.
945	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	579	2	After all, a transport layer based on user datagram protocol is more streamlined than a layer based on transmission control protocol, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of user datagram protocol, that option might be the better choice.	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.
946	WEBPAGE_TEMPLATE%ACTIVE_SERVER_PAGE	WEBPAGE TEMPLATE	ACTIVE SERVER PAGE	477	1	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.
947	WEBPAGE_TEMPLATE%JAVASERVER_PAGE	WEBPAGE TEMPLATE	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	2	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
948	WEBPAGE%BODY	WEBPAGE	BODY	385	1	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.	In both cases, the head contains preliminary information about the document (date, subject, etc. in the case of a memo).
949	WEBPAGE%HEAD	WEBPAGE	HEAD	385	1	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.	In both cases, the head contains preliminary information about the document (date, subject, etc. in the case of a memo).
950	WEBPAGE%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	WEBPAGE	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	264	1	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
951	WEBPAGE%WEBSERVER	WEBPAGE	WEBSERVER	466	1	In this case, the webserver is an intermediary between the client and the client's mail server.	Essentially, the webserver builds webpages that contain information from the mail server (a server-side activity) and sends those pages to the client where the client's browser displays them (a client-side activity).	Conversely, the browser allows the user to create messages (a client-side activity) and sends that information to the webserver, which then forwards the messages to the mail server (a server-side activity) for mailing.
952	WEBSERVER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	1	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
953	WEBSERVER%JAVASERVER_PAGE	WEBSERVER	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	1	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
954	WEBSERVER%SERVER-SIDE_ACTIVITY	WEBSERVER	SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
955	WEBSERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	WEBSERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	362	2	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.
956	WEBSERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	WEBSERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	366	2	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.	In short, the uniform resource locator in Figure 4.8 tells a browser to contact the webserver on the computer known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol hypertext transfer protocol and to retrieve the document named Julius_Caesar.html found within the subdirectory Shakespeare within the directory called authors.	Sometimes a uniform resource locator might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in Figure 4.8.
957	WEBSITE%SEARCH_ENGINE	WEBSITE	SEARCH ENGINE	444	1	The difference is subtle but important.	The semantic approach would allow search engines (websites that assist users in locating Web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".
958	WIDE_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	WIDE AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	166	4	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
959	WIDE_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	WIDE AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	4	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
960	WIDE_AREA_NETWORK%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	WIDE AREA NETWORK	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	176	5	The system of networks operated by the internet service providers can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall Internet structure (Figure 4.7).	At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 internet service providers that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international wide area networks.	These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.
961	WIFI_NETWORK%GATEWAY	WIFI NETWORK	GATEWAY	113	2	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.	Methods of Process Communication
962	WIFI_NETWORK%LINK_LAYER	WIFI NETWORK	LINK LAYER	531	2	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.
963	WIFI_NETWORK%ROUTER	WIFI NETWORK	ROUTER	97	1	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
964	WIFI_TECHNOLOGY%WIRELESS_CONNECTION	WIFI TECHNOLOGY	WIRELESS CONNECTION	192	1	The technology by which end systems connect to larger networks is also varied.	Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.
965	WIRELESS_NETWORK%ACCESS_POINT	WIRELESS NETWORK	ACCESS POINT	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
966	WIRELESS_NETWORK%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	WIRELESS NETWORK	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	1	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
967	WIRELESS_NETWORK%LINK_LAYER	WIRELESS NETWORK	LINK LAYER	530	1	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
968	WIRELESS_TELEPHONE%1G	WIRELESS TELEPHONE	1G	332	1	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
969	WIRELESS_TELEPHONE%3G	WIRELESS TELEPHONE	3G	334	1	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.
970	WIRELESS_TELEPHONE%4G	WIRELESS TELEPHONE	4G	335	1	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	The Generations of wireless telephones Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.
971	WIRELESS_TELEPHONE%SECOND_GENERATION	WIRELESS TELEPHONE	SECOND GENERATION	333	1	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.
972	WIRELESS_TELEPHONE%SMARTPHONES	WIRELESS TELEPHONE	SMARTPHONES	320	1	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.	Finally, the current generation of smartphones use wireless voice over internet protocol technology.	That is, earlier generations of wireless phones only communicated with the telephone company's network using that company's protocols.
973	WIRELESS%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	WIRELESS	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	1	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
974	WORLD_WIDE_WEB%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	WORLD WIDE WEB	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	390	1	CERN is where the original hypertext markup language markup language was developed as well as the hypertext transfer protocol protocol for transferring hypertext markup language documents over the Internet.	Today world wide web consortium is the source of many standards (including standards for extensible markup language and numerous multimedia applications) that lead to compatibility over a wide range of Internet products.	You can learn more about world wide web consortium via its website at http://www.w3c.org.
975	WORLD_WIDE_WEB%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	WORLD WIDE WEB	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	361	1	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.

In turn, by using an Internet-wide standard for marking documents according to semantics rather than appearance, a World Wide Semantic Web, rather than the World Wide Syntactic Web we have today, would be created.

In the United States this problem is addressed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.	It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.
