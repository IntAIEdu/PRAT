1	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	345	1	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.
2	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%END_SYSTEM	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	END SYSTEM	188	3	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.	The devices that individual users connect to the access internet service providers are known as end systems or hosts.	These end systems may be laptops or PCs, but increasingly range over a multitude of other devices including telephones, video cameras, automobiles, and home appliances.
3	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%INTRANET	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	INTRANET	186	1	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
4	ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%REGISTERED_DOMAIN	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	REGISTERED DOMAIN	257	3	For example, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the Internet as KingsandQueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its own network, maintain a link from this network to the Internet, and implement its own name server.	In this case, the club can contract with an access internet service provider to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the internet service provider.	Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the internet service provider, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the internet service provider to have that name included in the internet service provider's name server.
5	ACCESS_POINT%GATEWAY	ACCESS POINT	GATEWAY	113	2	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.	Methods of Process Communication
6	ACCESS_POINT%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	ACCESS POINT	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	4	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.
7	ACCESS_POINT%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	ACCESS POINT	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	67	4	This means that collisions between " newcomers " and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a " newcomer " is not allowed to claim a silent channel until any machine that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.	This protocol, however, does not solve the hidden terminal problem.	After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or busy channel requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.
8	ACCESS_POINT%HOT_SPOT	ACCESS POINT	HOT SPOT	194	4	The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.	The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.	Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.
9	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%BIT_PATTERN	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	BIT PATTERN	221	1	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.
10	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%DOMAIN	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	DOMAIN	225	2	For this reason the Internet has an alternative addressing system in which machines are identified by mnemonic names.	This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a " region " of the Internet operated by a single authority such as a university, club, company, or government agency.	The word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the Internet.
11	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	2	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
12	ADDRESSING_SYSTEM%MNEMONIC_ADDRESS	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	242	2	For example, if Yoyodyne Corporation was assigned the domain name yoyodyne.com, then an individual computer at Yoyodyne might have a name such as overthruster.propulsion.yoyodyne.com, meaning that the computer overthruster is in the subdomain propulsion within the domain yoyodyne within the Top-Level Domain com.	We should emphasize that the dotted notation used in mnemonic addresses is not related to the dotted decimal notation used to represent addresses in bit pattern form.	Although mnemonic addresses are convenient for humans, messages are always transferred over the Internet by means of internet protocol addresses.
13	APPLICATION_LAYER%NETWORK_LAYER	APPLICATION LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	504	1	A message typically originates in the application layer.	From there it is passed down through the transport and network layers as it is prepared for transmission, and finally it is transmitted by the link layer.	The message is received by the link layer at the destination and passed back up the hierarchy until it is delivered to the application layer at the message's destination.
14	APPLICATION_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	APPLICATION LAYER	PORT NUMBER	544	3	Determining which unit within the application layer should receive an incoming message is an important task of the transport layer.	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.
15	APPLICATION_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	APPLICATION LAYER	PORT NUMBER	545	3	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.	Users of the Internet rarely need to be concerned with port numbers because the common applications have universally accepted port numbers.
16	APPLICATION_LAYER%TRANSPORT_LAYER	APPLICATION LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	511	1	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
17	BIT_PATTERN%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	BIT PATTERN	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	716	2	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
18	BIT_PATTERN%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	217	1	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.
19	BRIDGE%ROUTER	BRIDGE	ROUTER	98	1	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
20	BRIDGE%SWITCH	BRIDGE	SWITCH	84	2	A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.	A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.	Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (Figure 4.4b).
21	BROWSER%CLIENT-SIDE	BROWSER	CLIENT-SIDE	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
22	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT	355	1	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
23	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	360	1	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
24	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	379	1	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.	The process is analogous to adding typesetting directions to a plain typed text (perhaps using a red pen) so that a typesetter will know how the material should appear in its final form.
25	BROWSER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	BROWSER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	1	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
26	BROWSER%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	BROWSER	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	690	2	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.	Some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.
27	BROWSER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	BROWSER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	362	2	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.
28	BROWSER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	BROWSER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	363	2	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.
29	BROWSER%WEBSERVER	BROWSER	WEBSERVER	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
30	BUS%BRIDGE	BUS	BRIDGE	77	4	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
31	BUS%BRIDGE	BUS	BRIDGE	79	4	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.
32	BUS%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	BUS	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
33	BUS%ETHERNET_NETWORK	BUS	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	4	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
34	BUS%HUB	BUS	HUB	33	3	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
35	BUS%HUB	BUS	HUB	34	3	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.	All it does is relay any signal it receives (with perhaps some amplification) back out to all the machines connected to it.
36	BUS%REPEATER	BUS	REPEATER	77	4	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
37	BUS%REPEATER	BUS	REPEATER	78	4	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.
38	BUS%SWITCH	BUS	SWITCH	77	3	For example, in the case of bus networks based on the Ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.	This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).
39	CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	LINK LAYER	530	3	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
40	CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	LINK LAYER	531	3	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.
41	CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION%LINK_LAYER	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	LINK LAYER	530	3	Thus the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.	For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.	If the network is a wifi network, the link layer applies carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance.
42	CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY%CERTIFICATE	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	CERTIFICATE	710	2	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.
43	CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY%CERTIFICATE	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	CERTIFICATE	711	2	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.	Many commercial certificate authorities are now available on the Internet, although it is also common for organizations to maintain their own certificate authorities in order to maintain tighter control over the security of the organization's communication.
44	CLIENT_SIDE%CLIENT	CLIENT SIDE	CLIENT	476	1	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
45	CLIENT%APPLICATION_LAYER	CLIENT	APPLICATION LAYER	508	3	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
46	CLIENT%CERTIFICATE	CLIENT	CERTIFICATE	710	1	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.
47	CLIENT%CLIENT-SIDE	CLIENT	CLIENT-SIDE	457	3	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
48	CLIENT%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	CLIENT	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
49	CLIENT%FIREWALL	CLIENT	FIREWALL	654	1	In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine server on the infected computer by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware's findings.	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.	Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes-an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.
50	CLIENT%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	CLIENT	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	1	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
51	CLIENT%PROXY_SERVER	CLIENT	PROXY SERVER	660	3	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
52	CLIENT%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	CLIENT	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
53	CLIENT%SERVLETS	CLIENT	SERVLETS	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
54	CLIENT%WEBSERVER	CLIENT	WEBSERVER	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
55	COLLISION_AVOIDANCE%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	1	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
56	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	COMPUTER SYSTEM	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	1	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
57	COMPUTER_SYSTEM%TROJAN_HORSE	COMPUTER SYSTEM	TROJAN HORSE	613	1	A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.	Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.
58	COMPUTER%ADDRESSING_SYSTEM	COMPUTER	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	214	1	Internet Addressing	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.
59	COMPUTER%COMPUTER_SYSTEM	COMPUTER	COMPUTER SYSTEM	1	3		The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.
60	COMPUTER%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE	COMPUTER	DENIAL OF SERVICE	630	1	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
61	COMPUTER%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	COMPUTER	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	1	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
62	COMPUTER%MASS_STORAGE	COMPUTER	MASS STORAGE	302	1	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.
63	COMPUTER%NETWORK	COMPUTER	NETWORK	1	4		The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.
64	COMPUTER%SOFTWARE	COMPUTER	SOFTWARE	2	2	The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.
65	COMPUTER%SOFTWARE	COMPUTER	SOFTWARE	486	2	In this section we investigate how messages are transferred over the Internet.	This transfer process requires the cooperation of all the computers in the system, and therefore software for controlling this process resides on every computer in the Internet.	We begin by studying the overall structure of this software.
66	COMPUTER%SPYWARE	COMPUTER	SPYWARE	620	1	Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.	Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.	Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.
67	COMPUTER%TROJAN_HORSE	COMPUTER	TROJAN HORSE	614	1	A trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.	Once in the computer, however, the trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.	Sometimes these additional activities start immediately.
68	COMPUTER%VIRUS	COMPUTER	VIRUS	606	1	The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.	A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.	Then, when the " host " program is executed, the virus is also executed.
69	DENIAL_OF_SERVICE%FIREWALL	DENIAL OF SERVICE	FIREWALL	646	1	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.	This latter function is a tool for terminating a denial of service attack because it provides a means of blocking traffic from the attacking computers.
70	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%CLOUD_COMPUTING	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	CLOUD COMPUTING	160	4	Enabled by the growing connectivity of the Internet, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home PCs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.	Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.	Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the Internet is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to " the Cloud ", which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.
71	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%CLUSTER_COMPUTE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	CLUSTER COMPUTE	152	4	Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.	Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent computers work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger machine.	The cost of these individual machines, plus the high-speed network to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.
72	DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM%GRID_COMPUTE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	GRID COMPUTE	155	4	Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability-because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable-and load-balancing-because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.	Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.	Grid computing can involve specialized software to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the machines participating in a grid.
73	DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	579	1	After all, a transport layer based on user datagram protocol is more streamlined than a layer based on transmission control protocol, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of user datagram protocol, that option might be the better choice.	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.
74	DOMAIN_NAME%MNEMONIC_DOMAIN_NAME	DOMAIN NAME	MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME	228	2	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
75	DOMAIN_NAME%NAME_SERVER	DOMAIN NAME	NAME SERVER	248	1	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.	Thus, for a machine to be accessible by means of a mnemonic domain name, that name must be represented in a name server within the domain name system.	In those cases in which the entity establishing the domain has the resources, it can establish and maintain its own name server containing all the names within that domain.
76	DOMAIN_NAME%SUBDOMAINS	DOMAIN NAME	SUBDOMAINS	239	2	Note that domain names are extended to the left and separated by a period.	In some cases multiple extensions, called subdomains, are used as a means of organizing the names within a domain.	These subdomains often represent different networks within the domain's jurisdiction.
77	DOMAIN%DOMAIN_NAME	DOMAIN	DOMAIN NAME	228	4	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
78	DOMAIN%DOMAIN_NAME	DOMAIN	DOMAIN NAME	229	4	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.	As an example, the domain name of Marquette University is mu.edu.
79	DOMAIN%MNEMONIC_DOMAIN_NAME	DOMAIN	MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME	228	3	Each domain must be registered with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers-a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.	As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a mnemonic domain name, which is unique among all the domain names throughout the Internet.	Domain names are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.
80	DOMAIN%REGISTERED_DOMAIN	DOMAIN	REGISTERED DOMAIN	257	2	For example, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the Internet as KingsandQueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its own network, maintain a link from this network to the Internet, and implement its own name server.	In this case, the club can contract with an access internet service provider to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the internet service provider.	Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the internet service provider, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the internet service provider to have that name included in the internet service provider's name server.
81	DOMAIN%SUBDOMAINS	DOMAIN	SUBDOMAINS	239	2	Note that domain names are extended to the left and separated by a period.	In some cases multiple extensions, called subdomains, are used as a means of organizing the names within a domain.	These subdomains often represent different networks within the domain's jurisdiction.
82	DOMAIN%TOP-LEVEL_DOMAINS	DOMAIN	TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS	233	3	It is used to reflect the domain's classification, which in this case is " educational " as indicated by the edu suffix.	These suffixes are called Top-Level Domains (TLDs).	Other Top-Level Domains include com for commercial institutions, gov for U.S. government institutions, org for nonprofit organizations, museum for museums, info for unrestricted use, and net, which was originally intended for internet service providers but is now used on a much broader scale.
83	EMAIL%BODY	EMAIL	BODY	289	3	In line 7, the remote server acknowledges that it will receive email destined for that user.	In line 8, the sending server dispenses with the introductions, and announces that it is ready to send the DATA, the actual body of the e-mail message.	In line 8, the remote server acknowledges (with code 354, in accordance with the simple mail transfer protocol protocol) that it is ready to receive the body of the message and includes a helpful human-readable instruction on how to conclude the message transfer.
84	EMAIL%FIREWALL	EMAIL	FIREWALL	651	2	Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains.	For example, if a computer is not being used as a webserver, a name server, or an email server, then a firewall should be installed at that computer to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.	Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a computer is by establishing contact through a " hole " left by a nonexistent server.
85	EMAIL%FIREWALL	EMAIL	FIREWALL	655	2	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.	Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes-an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.	Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.
86	EMAIL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	EMAIL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	2	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
87	EMAIL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	EMAIL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	303	2	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.	internet mail access protocol (pronounced " EYE-map ") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.	In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.
88	EMAIL%MAIL_SERVER	EMAIL	MAIL SERVER	270	3	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
89	EMAIL%MAIL_SERVER	EMAIL	MAIL SERVER	271	3	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.
90	EMAIL%PHISHING	EMAIL	PHISHING	625	2	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".	Phishing is often carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more than an old telephone con.	The perpetrator sends email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency.
91	EMAIL%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	EMAIL	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
92	EMAIL%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	EMAIL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	3	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
93	EMAIL%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	EMAIL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	548	3	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.	In summary, communication over the Internet involves the interaction of four layers of software.
94	EMAIL%TROJAN_HORSE	EMAIL	TROJAN HORSE	617	2	In other instances, the trojan horse might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected date.	trojan horses often arrive in the form of attachments to enticing email messages.	When the attachment is opened (that is, when the recipient asks to view the attachment), the misdeeds of the trojan horse are activated.
95	ENCRYPTION%PRIVATE-KEY	ENCRYPTION	PRIVATE-KEY	697	1	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
96	ENCRYPTION%PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION	ENCRYPTION	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	692	4	Some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.	One of the more fascinating topics in the field of encryption is public-key encryption, which involves techniques by which encryption systems are designed so that having knowledge about how messages are encrypted does not allow one to decrypt messages.	This characteristic is somewhat counterintuitive.
97	ETHERNET_NETWORK%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	ETHERNET NETWORK	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	1	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
98	ETHERNET_NETWORK%HUB	ETHERNET NETWORK	HUB	33	1	Instead, it may have a very short bus with long links to the individual machines, meaning that the network would look more like a star.	Indeed, sometimes a bus network is created by running links from each computer to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.	This hub is little more than a very short bus.
99	EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	433	1	Following the extensible markup language standard, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.	In fact, hypertext markup language is the markup language based on the extensible markup language standard that was developed for representing webpages.	Actually, the original version of hypertext markup language was developed before the extensible markup language standard was solidified, and therefore some features of hypertext markup language do not strictly conform to extensible markup language.
100	FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%APPLICATION_LAYER	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	APPLICATION LAYER	511	1	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
101	FIREWALL%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	FIREWALL	AUDITING SOFTWARE	672	1	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
102	FORWARDING_TABLE%NETWORK_LAYER	FORWARDING TABLE	NETWORK LAYER	526	2	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.	Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.	Having determined the proper direction, the network layer hands the packet to the link layer for actual transmission.
103	GATEWAY%FIREWALL	GATEWAY	FIREWALL	645	3	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
104	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	1	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
105	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%TAG	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	TAG	377	3	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).
106	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	361	3	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).	Each uniform resource locator contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.
107	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	WEBSERVER	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
108	HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	1	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
109	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%BODY	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	BODY	384	4	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
110	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%EXTENSIBLE_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE	390	1	CERN is where the original hypertext markup language markup language was developed as well as the hypertext transfer protocol protocol for transferring hypertext markup language documents over the Internet.	Today world wide web consortium is the source of many standards (including standards for extensible markup language and numerous multimedia applications) that lead to compatibility over a wide range of Internet products.	You can learn more about world wide web consortium via its website at http://www.w3c.org.
111	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%HEAD	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	HEAD	384	4	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
112	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%SEARCH_ENGINE	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	SEARCH ENGINE	444	1	The difference is subtle but important.	The semantic approach would allow search engines (websites that assist users in locating Web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".
113	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%TAG	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	TAG	381	2	The process is analogous to adding typesetting directions to a plain typed text (perhaps using a red pen) so that a typesetter will know how the material should appear in its final form.	In the case of hypertext, the red markings are replaced by hypertext markup language tags, and a browser ultimately plays the role of the typesetter, reading the hypertext markup language tags to learn how the text is to be presented on the computer screen.	The hypertext markup language-encoded version (called the source version) of an extremely simple webpage is shown in Figure 4.9a.
114	HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE%TAG	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	TAG	383	2	The hypertext markup language-encoded version (called the source version) of an extremely simple webpage is shown in Figure 4.9a.	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).
115	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL_SERVER%PORT_NUMBER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER	PORT NUMBER	547	1	Users of the Internet rarely need to be concerned with port numbers because the common applications have universally accepted port numbers.	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.
116	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%END_USER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	END USER	266	1	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.
117	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%INSTANT_MESSAGING	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	INSTANT MESSAGING	266	1	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.

One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.
118	HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	688	2	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.
119	HYPERTEXT%BROWSER	HYPERTEXT	BROWSER	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
120	HYPERTEXT%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	HYPERTEXT	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	352	3	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.

121	HYPERTEXT%PHP	HYPERTEXT	PHP	478	1	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.	Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and servers to execute programs on the other's machine.
122	HYPERTEXT%WEBSERVERS	HYPERTEXT	WEBSERVERS	355	1	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.

123	HYPERTEXT%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	HYPERTEXT	WORLD WIDE WEB	350	2	4.3 The world wide web	The world wide web had its origins in the work of Tim Berners-Lee who realized the potential of combining internet technology with the concept of linkeddocuments, called hypertext.	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.
124	HYPERTEXT%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	HYPERTEXT	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	2	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.

125	INTERNET_INFRASTRUCTURE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	1	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
126	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%BIT_PATTERN	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	BIT PATTERN	221	2	Thus, machines throughout the Internet are assigned unique internet protocol addresses. internet protocol addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.	For example, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte bit pattern 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte bit pattern consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).	In summary, a 32-bit internet protocol address might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.
127	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS%NAME_SERVER	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	NAME SERVER	245	1	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
128	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK%4G	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	4G	342	1	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.
129	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	HOP COUNT	584	3	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
130	INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	HOP COUNT	586	3	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.	Each time an internet protocol network layer forwards a packet, it decrements that packet's hop count by one.	With this information, the network layer can protect the Internet from packets circling endlessly within the system.
131	INTERNET_PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	217	1	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.
132	INTERNET_PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	INTERNET PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
133	INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	186	2	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
134	INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	218	2	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).	Blocks of consecutively numbered internet protocol addresses are awarded to internet service providers by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.	The internet service providers are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to machines within their region of authority.
135	INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	176	3	The system of networks operated by the internet service providers can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall Internet structure (Figure 4.7).	At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 internet service providers that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international wide area networks.	These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.
136	INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	180	2	An example would be a company that originated as a traditional telephone company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.
137	INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	181	2	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.
138	INTERNET_SOFTWARE%APPLICATION_LAYER	INTERNET SOFTWARE	APPLICATION LAYER	502	4	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
139	INTERNET_SOFTWARE%LINK_LAYER	INTERNET SOFTWARE	LINK LAYER	502	4	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
140	INTERNET_SOFTWARE%NETWORK_LAYER	INTERNET SOFTWARE	NETWORK LAYER	502	4	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
141	INTERNET_SOFTWARE%TRANSPORT_LAYER	INTERNET SOFTWARE	TRANSPORT LAYER	502	4	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).	A message typically originates in the application layer.
142	INTERNET%4G	INTERNET	4G	323	2	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.	Internet Multimedia Streaming
143	INTERNET%ACCESS_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	186	3	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.	Examples include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide internet access to individuals within their organizations.
144	INTERNET%ADDRESSING_SYSTEM	INTERNET	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	214	3	Internet Addressing	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.
145	INTERNET%APPLICATION_LAYER	INTERNET	APPLICATION LAYER	508	1	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
146	INTERNET%BROWSER	INTERNET	BROWSER	264	3	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
147	INTERNET%BROWSER	INTERNET	BROWSER	268	3	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
148	INTERNET%BROWSER	INTERNET	BROWSER	355	3	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
149	INTERNET%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	INTERNET	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	3	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
150	INTERNET%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	INTERNET	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	2	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
151	INTERNET%DOMAIN	INTERNET	DOMAIN	225	2	For this reason the Internet has an alternative addressing system in which machines are identified by mnemonic names.	This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a " region " of the Internet operated by a single authority such as a university, club, company, or government agency.	The word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the Internet.
152	INTERNET%EMAIL	INTERNET	EMAIL	267	4	Electronic Mail A wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging messages between end users over the network; instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, Twitter-based " tweets ", and the Facebook " wall " are but a few.	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.
153	INTERNET%ENCRYPTION	INTERNET	ENCRYPTION	686	2	However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over networks and internets where messages are relayed by unknown entities.	In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.
154	INTERNET%ENCRYPTION	INTERNET	ENCRYPTION	687	2	In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.	Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called " secure versions " of the applications.	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.
155	INTERNET%END_USER	INTERNET	END USER	212	1	As alluded to in Chapter 2, several clever schemes have been developed to extend these legacy analog links to accommodate transmission of digital data.	DSL modems, cable modems, satellite uplinks, and even direct fiber-optic connections to the home are used to bring broadband internet access to end users.	Internet Addressing
156	INTERNET%GATEWAY	INTERNET	GATEWAY	109	3	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.
157	INTERNET%HOP_COUNT	INTERNET	HOP COUNT	584	1	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
158	INTERNET%INTERNET_INFRASTRUCTURE	INTERNET	INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE	306	3	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
159	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL	216	2	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).
160	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL	561	2	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
161	INTERNET%INTERNET_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS	INTERNET	INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS	215	4	As we learned in Section 4.1, an internet needs an internet-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each computer in the system.	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.
162	INTERNET%INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	172	3	As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.	In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).	It is also customary to use the term internet service provider in reference to the networks themselves.
163	INTERNET%INTERNET_SOFTWARE	INTERNET	INTERNET SOFTWARE	501	2	Each level in the hierarchy has representatives at both the origin and the destination, with the representatives at the destination tending to do the reverse of their counterparts at the origin.	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).
164	INTERNET%INTERNET2	INTERNET	INTERNET2	198	4	Internet2	Now that the Internet has shifted from a research project to a household commodity, the research community has moved on to a project called Internet2.	Internet2 is intended as an academic-only system and involves numerous universities working in partnership with industry and government.
165	INTERNET%INTERNET2	INTERNET	INTERNET2	199	4	Now that the Internet has shifted from a research project to a household commodity, the research community has moved on to a project called Internet2.	Internet2 is intended as an academic-only system and involves numerous universities working in partnership with industry and government.	The goal is to conduct research in internet applications requiring high bandwidth communication, such as remote access and control of costly state-of-the-art equipment such as telescopes and medical diagnostic devices.
166	INTERNET%INTRANET	INTERNET	INTRANET	252	1	Each registered domain represented a physical region of the Internet that was operated by a local authority such as a company, university, or government agency.	This authority was essentially an access internet service provider that provided internet access to its members by means of its own intranet that was linked to the Internet.	As part of this system, the organization maintained its own name server that provided translation services for all the names used within its domain.
167	INTERNET%PROTOCOL	INTERNET	PROTOCOL	19	1	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.	Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.
168	INTERNET%ROUTER	INTERNET	ROUTER	97	1	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
169	INTERNET%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	176	1	The system of networks operated by the internet service providers can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall Internet structure (Figure 4.7).	At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 internet service providers that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international wide area networks.	These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.
170	INTERNET%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	1	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.
171	INTERNET%TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	INTERNET	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	185	2	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.
172	INTERNET%TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE	INTERNET	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	96	1	There are many other examples of internets.	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.
173	INTERNET%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	561	1	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
174	INTERNET%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	INTERNET	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	3	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
175	INTERNET%WEBSERVERS	INTERNET	WEBSERVERS	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
176	INTERNET%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	INTERNET	WORLD WIDE WEB	350	4	4.3 The world wide web	The world wide web had its origins in the work of Tim Berners-Lee who realized the potential of combining internet technology with the concept of linkeddocuments, called hypertext.	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.
177	INTERNET%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	INTERNET	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	4	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
178	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%CLIENT	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	CLIENT	117	4	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
179	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
180	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	127	2	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.	However, the client/server model is not the only means of interprocess communication.	Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model.
181	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	130	3	Whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (Figure 4.6).	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.
182	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	131	3	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.	The peer-to-peer model is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the Internet.
183	INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION%SERVER	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	SERVER	117	4	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.
184	INTRANET%FIREWALL	INTRANET	FIREWALL	645	1	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
185	JAVASERVER_PAGE%ACTIVE_SERVER_PAGE	JAVASERVER PAGE	ACTIVE SERVER PAGE	477	1	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.
186	LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	1	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
187	MAGNETIC_DISK%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	MAGNETIC DISK	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	122	1	In this case the printer played the role of a server (often called a print server), and the other machines were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the print server.	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.
188	MAGNETIC_DISK%MASS_STORAGE	MAGNETIC DISK	MASS STORAGE	123	1	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.
189	MAIL_SERVER%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	2	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
190	MAIL_SERVER%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MAIL SERVER	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	2	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
191	MAIL_SERVER%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	MAIL SERVER	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	301	2	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.	This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.
192	MAIL_SERVER%REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER	MAIL SERVER	REMOTE MAIL SERVER	275	2	Similarly, when the server process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.	The transcript of their simple mail transfer protocol exchange might look something like this: In line 1, the remote mail server process answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.
193	MAIL_SERVER%SERVER-SIDE	MAIL SERVER	SERVER-SIDE	466	1	In this case, the webserver is an intermediary between the client and the client's mail server.	Essentially, the webserver builds webpages that contain information from the mail server (a server-side activity) and sends those pages to the client where the client's browser displays them (a client-side activity).	Conversely, the browser allows the user to create messages (a client-side activity) and sends that information to the webserver, which then forwards the messages to the mail server (a server-side activity) for mailing.
194	MAIL_SERVER%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	280	1	To be sure, the quaint politeness of " pleased to meet you " in line 3 is neither appreciated by the software on either end of this connection, nor essential to simple mail transfer protocol's proper function.	However, this is actual behavior built into one popular simple mail transfer protocol mail server, held over from the early days of the Internet when human operators frequently needed to review simple mail transfer protocol transcripts to debug incompatibilities between mail servers.	Untold millions of these exchanges occur on the network each day, known only to the software agents that transport email across the Internet.
195	MAIL_SERVER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	580	2	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.
196	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%SPYWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
197	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
198	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%VIRUS	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	VIRUS	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
199	MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE%WORM	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	WORM	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
200	MASS_STORAGE%MAGNETIC_DISK	MASS STORAGE	MAGNETIC DISK	123	2	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.	Here one machine in a network was equipped with a high-capacity mass storage system (usually a magnetic disk) that contained all of an organization's records.	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.
201	MASS_STORAGE%VIRUS	MASS STORAGE	VIRUS	609	2	When executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the computer.	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.
202	METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	1	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
203	MNEMONIC_ADDRESS%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	MNEMONIC ADDRESS	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	1	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
204	NAME_SERVER%APPLICATION_LAYER	NAME SERVER	APPLICATION LAYER	513	1	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.	To fulfill this need, the application layer may use the services of the name servers within the Internet to translate mnemonic addresses used by humans into Internet-compatible internet protocol addresses.	An important task of the transport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet.
205	NAME_SERVER%DOMAIN	NAME SERVER	DOMAIN	249	1	Thus, for a machine to be accessible by means of a mnemonic domain name, that name must be represented in a name server within the domain name system.	In those cases in which the entity establishing the domain has the resources, it can establish and maintain its own name server containing all the names within that domain.	Indeed, this is the model on which the domain system was originally based.
206	NAME_SERVER%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	NAME SERVER	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	246	4	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).	The process of using domain name system to perform a translation is called a domain name system lookup.
207	NETWORK_LAYER%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	NETWORK LAYER	INTERNET PROTOCOL	589	1	Although the Internet continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial hop count of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today's internet service providers.	For years a version of internet protocol known as IPv4 (internet protocol version four) has been used for implementing the network layer within the Internet.	However, the Internet is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit internet addressing system dictated by internet protocol version four.
208	NETWORK_LAYER%LINK_LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	LINK LAYER	504	2	A message typically originates in the application layer.	From there it is passed down through the transport and network layers as it is prepared for transmission, and finally it is transmitted by the link layer.	The message is received by the link layer at the destination and passed back up the hierarchy until it is delivered to the application layer at the message's destination.
209	NETWORK_LAYER%LINK_LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	LINK LAYER	533	2	When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other end of the connection.	There, the link layer hands the packet up to its network layer where the packet's final destination is compared to the network layer's forwarding table to determine the direction of the packet's next step.	With this decision made, the network layer returns the packet to the link layer to be forwarded along its way.
210	NETWORK_SOFTWARE%INTERNET	NETWORK SOFTWARE	INTERNET	490	1	A principal task of networking software is to provide the infrastructure required for transferring messages from one machine to another.	In the Internet, this message-passing activity is accomplished by means of a hierarchy of software units, which perform tasks analogous to those that would be performed if you were to send a gift in a package from the West Coast of the United States to a friend on the East Coast (Figure 4.12).	You would first wrap the gift as a package and write the appropriate address on the outside of the package.
211	NETWORK%4G	NETWORK	4G	323	1	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

212	NETWORK%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	1	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
213	NETWORK%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	2	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.
214	NETWORK%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	AUDITING SOFTWARE	672	2	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).

In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.
215	NETWORK%BUS	NETWORK	BUS	23	4	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
216	NETWORK%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	NETWORK	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
217	NETWORK%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	NETWORK	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	2	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
218	NETWORK%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	NETWORK	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	345	2	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.	A networking technology called anycast, which enables an end user to automatically connect to the closest server out of a defined group of servers, helps to make content delivery networks practical.
219	NETWORK%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	NETWORK	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	3	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
220	NETWORK%END_SYSTEM	NETWORK	END SYSTEM	191	1	After all, the Internet is essentially a communications system, and thus any device that would benefit from communicating with other devices is a potential end system.	The technology by which end systems connect to larger networks is also varied.	Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.
221	NETWORK%ETHERNET_NETWORK	NETWORK	ETHERNET NETWORK	24	1	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.	The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.
222	NETWORK%FIREWALL	NETWORK	FIREWALL	644	3	The old adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections.	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.
223	NETWORK%GATEWAY	NETWORK	GATEWAY	109	1	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.
224	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	18	4	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.	The Internet (a popular worldwide network of networks that we will study in this chapter) is an open system.	In particular, communication throughout the Internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite, which is the subject of Section 4.4.
225	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	92	4	For instance, the characteristics of a wifi network are not readily compatible with an ethernet network.	In these cases the networks must be connected in a manner that builds a network of networks, known as an internet, in which the original networks maintain their individuality and continue to function as autonomous networks.	Note that the generic term internet is distinct from the Internet.
226	NETWORK%INTERNET	NETWORK	INTERNET	166	4	4.2 The Internet	The most notable example of an internet is the Internet (note the uppercase I), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.	The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of computer networks so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.
227	NETWORK%INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	NETWORK	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	172	1	As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.	In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).	It is also customary to use the term internet service provider in reference to the networks themselves.
228	NETWORK%INTERPROCESS_COMMUNICATION	NETWORK	INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION	116	2	The various activities (or processes) executing on the different computers within a network (or even executing on the same machine via time-sharing/multitasking) must often communicate with each other to coordinate their actions and to perform their designated tasks.	Such communication between processes is called interprocess communication.	A popular convention used for interprocess communication is the client / server model.
229	NETWORK%LOCAL_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	LOCAL AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
230	NETWORK%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	NETWORK	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	1	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
231	NETWORK%METROPOLITAN_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
232	NETWORK%OPEN_NETWORK	NETWORK	OPEN NETWORK	16	3	Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.	A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.
233	NETWORK%PERSONAL_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	PERSONAL AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
234	NETWORK%PHONE_NETWORK	NETWORK	PHONE NETWORK	323	3	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

235	NETWORK%PHONE_NETWORK	NETWORK	PHONE NETWORK	334	3	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.	The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.
236	NETWORK%PROTOCOL	NETWORK	PROTOCOL	37	1	The result is a network that looks like a star network although it operates like a bus network.	Protocols For a network to function reliably, it is important to establish rules by which activities are conducted.	Such rules are called protocols.
237	NETWORK%ROUTER	NETWORK	ROUTER	97	3	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.
238	NETWORK%SERVER	NETWORK	SERVER	345	1	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".

239	NETWORK%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	NETWORK	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	1	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
240	NETWORK%STAR	NETWORK	STAR	23	4	Still another way of classifying networks is based on the topology of the network, which refers to the pattern in which the machines are connected.	Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (Figure 4.1a), and the star, in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (Figure 4.1b).	The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as Ethernet, and ethernet networks remain one of the most popular networking systems in use today.
241	NETWORK%STAR	NETWORK	STAR	27	4	It evolved from the paradigm of a large central computer serving many users.	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.
242	NETWORK%STAR	NETWORK	STAR	28	4	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
243	NETWORK%WIDE_AREA_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIDE AREA NETWORK	9	4	Network Classifications	A computer network is often classified as being either a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN).	A personal area network is normally used for shortrange communications-typically less than a few meters-such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its PC.
244	NETWORK%WIFI_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIFI NETWORK	69	1	After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or busy channel requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.	To solve this problem, some wifi networks require that each machine send a short " request " message to the access point and wait until the access point acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire message.	If the access point is busy because it is dealing with a " hidden terminal ", it will ignore the request, and the requesting machine will know to wait.
245	NETWORK%WIRELESS_NETWORK	NETWORK	WIRELESS NETWORK	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
246	NETWORK%WORM	NETWORK	WORM	610	2	Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.	A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.	As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.
247	OPEN_NETWORK%INTERNET	OPEN NETWORK	INTERNET	18	1	Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.

248	PEER-TO-PEER_MODEL%INSTANT_MESSAGING	PEER-TO-PEER MODEL	INSTANT MESSAGING	131	3	Moreover, whereas a server must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the peer-to-peer model usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.	For example, applications of the peer-to-peer model include instant messaging in which people carry on a written conversation over the Internet as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.	The peer-to-peer model is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the Internet.

In contrast, a local area network normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.	For example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a local area network.
251	PHONE_NETWORK%1G	PHONE NETWORK	1G	332	2	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
252	PHONE_NETWORK%3G	PHONE NETWORK	3G	334	2	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.

255	PRIVATE-KEY%BIT_PATTERN	PRIVATE-KEY	BIT PATTERN	716	1	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
256	PRIVATE-KEY%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	PRIVATE-KEY	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	716	3	That is, text can be encrypted with the private-key, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.	In this manner, the holder of the private-key can produce a bit pattern, called a digital signature, that only that party knows how to produce.	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.
257	PRIVATE-KEY%DIGITAL_SIGNATURE	PRIVATE-KEY	DIGITAL SIGNATURE	718	3	By attaching that signature to a message, the sender can mark the message as being authentic.	A digital signature can be as simple as the encrypted version of the message itself.	All the sender must do is encrypt the message being transmitted using his or her private-key (the key typically used for decrypting).

259	PROTOCOL%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	PROTOCOL	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	2	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
260	PROTOCOL%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_DETECTION	PROTOCOL	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION DETECTION	43	4	Without rules governing this communication, all the computers might insist on transmitting messages at the same time or fail to assist other machines when that assistance is required.	In a bus network based on the Ethernet standards, the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).	This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus (Figure 4.2).
261	PROTOCOL%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	PROTOCOL	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	58	1	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.
262	PROTOCOL%DOMAIN_NAME_SYSTEM	PROTOCOL	DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM	272	1	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.	This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.
263	PROTOCOL%FILE_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	3	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.

These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
269	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL	216	2	In the Internet these addresses are known as internet protocol addresses.	The term internet protocol refers to " internet protocol ", which is a term we will learn more about in Section 4.4.	Originally, each internet protocol address was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of internet protocolv6 in Section 4.4).
270	PROTOCOL%INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	INTERNET PROTOCOL	561	2	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.
271	PROTOCOL%NETWORK_NEWS_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	NETWORK NEWS TRANSFER PROTOCOL	263	3	In the earlier days of the Internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol.	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
272	PROTOCOL%PHONE_NETWORK	PROTOCOL	PHONE NETWORK	323	1	Access to the Internet was obtained by gateways between the company's network and the Internet, at which point signals were converted to the transmission control protocol/internet protocol system.	However, the 4G phone network is an internet protocol-based network throughout, which means a 4G telephone is essentially just another broadband-connected host computer on the global Internet.

As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
275	PROTOCOL%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	PROTOCOL	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	2	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
276	PROTOCOL%SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	268	2	One of the oldest and most enduring uses of the Internet is the electronic mail system, or email for short.	While many users now rely on their browser or a sophisticated application like Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's Mail, or Mozilla's Thunderbird to read and compose their email, the actual transmission of email messages from one computer to another on the Internet remains the domain of basic network protocols like simple mail transfer protocol.	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
277	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	561	2	The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.

More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).
279	PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
280	PROTOCOL%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	PROTOCOL	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	1	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
281	PROTOCOL%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	563	2	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.
282	PROTOCOL%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	PROTOCOL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	2	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
283	PROTOCOL%WORLD_WIDE_WEB	PROTOCOL	WORLD WIDE WEB	352	1	His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.	program == software	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.
284	PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION%PRIVATE-KEY	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	PRIVATE-KEY	697	2	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
285	PUBLIC-KEY_ENCRYPTION%PUBLIC-KEY	PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION	PUBLIC-KEY	697	2	A public-key encryption system involves the use of two values called keys.	One key, known as the public-key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private-key, is required to decrypt messages.	To use the system, the public-key is first distributed to those who might need to send messages to a particular destination.
286	PUBLIC-KEY%CERTIFICATE	PUBLIC-KEY	CERTIFICATE	710	1	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.
287	PUBLIC-KEY%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	PUBLIC-KEY	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	1	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
288	REPEATER%BRIDGE	REPEATER	BRIDGE	79	1	The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (Figure 4.4a).	A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.	Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.
289	REPEATER%ROUTER	REPEATER	ROUTER	98	1	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
290	ROUTER%ADDRESSING_SYSTEM	ROUTER	ADDRESSING SYSTEM	104	3	The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward messages in their proper directions.	This forwarding process is based on an internetwide addressing system in which all the devices in an internet (including the machines in the original networks and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.	Thus, each machine in one of the original networks has two addresses: its original " local " address within its own network and its internet address.
291	ROUTER%FORWARDING_TABLE	ROUTER	FORWARDING TABLE	108	4	From there it is forwarded in the proper direction.	For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a forwarding table that contains the router's knowledge about the direction in which messages should be sent depending on their destination addresses.	The " point " at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.
292	ROUTER%GATEWAY	ROUTER	GATEWAY	111	2	Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.	In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.
293	ROUTER%GATEWAY	ROUTER	GATEWAY	113	2	In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.	For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.	Methods of Process Communication
294	ROUTER%HOP_COUNT	ROUTER	HOP COUNT	584	2	Much of the internet protocol standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring network layers as they interchange routing information.	An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an internet protocol network layer at a message's origin prepares a packet, it appends a value called a hop count, or time to live, to that packet.	This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the Internet.
295	ROUTER%LINK_LAYER	ROUTER	LINK LAYER	523	2	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
296	ROUTER%LINK_LAYER	ROUTER	LINK LAYER	525	2	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.	Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.
297	ROUTER%NETWORK_LAYER	ROUTER	NETWORK LAYER	523	3	It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.
298	ROUTER%NETWORK_LAYER	ROUTER	NETWORK LAYER	524	3	In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.	The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.	The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.
299	ROUTER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	ROUTER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	183	1	Again, these networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.	Tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.
300	SEARCH_ENGINE%CLIENT-SIDE	SEARCH ENGINE	CLIENT-SIDE	463	1	Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.	In this case a user at the client specifies a topic of interest (a client-side activity), which is then transferred to the search engine where a customized webpage identifying documents of possible interest is constructed (a server-side activity) and sent back to the client.	Still another example occurs in the case of Web mail-an increasingly popular means by which computer users are able to access their email by means of Web browsers.
301	SECURE_SHELL%APPLICATION_LAYER	SECURE SHELL	APPLICATION LAYER	511	1	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
302	SERVER_SIDE%SERVLET	SERVER SIDE	SERVLET	475	1	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.
303	SERVER-SIDE%PHP	SERVER-SIDE	PHP	478	3	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.	Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and servers to execute programs on the other's machine.
304	SERVER-SIDE%SERVLETS	SERVER-SIDE	SERVLETS	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
305	SERVER%APPLICATION_LAYER	SERVER	APPLICATION LAYER	508	3	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
306	SERVER%CERTIFICATE	SERVER	CERTIFICATE	710	1	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.	A certificate is a package containing a party's name and that party's public-key.
307	SERVER%CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY	SERVER	CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY	709	2	Thus, the task of associating public-keys with correct parties is significant.	One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted Internet sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their public-keys.	These authorities, acting as servers, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.
308	SERVER%CLIENT/SERVER_MODEL	SERVER	CLIENT/SERVER MODEL	119	2	This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a server, which satisfies the requests made by clients.	An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting all the computers in a cluster of offices.	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.
309	SERVER%CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK	SERVER	CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK	344	3	In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.	Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network " neighborhood ".	In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.
310	SERVER%FILE_SERVER	SERVER	FILE SERVER	125	3	Other machines on the network then requested access to the records as they needed them.	Thus the machine that actually contained the records played the role of a server (called a file server), and the other machines played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the file server.	Today the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, as we will see later in this chapter.
311	SERVER%MAIL_SERVER	SERVER	MAIL SERVER	270	2	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
312	SERVER%MAIL_SERVER	SERVER	MAIL SERVER	271	2	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.	To accomplish this, it uses domain name system, another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain name to the proper mail server name, and then to its internet protocol address.
313	SERVER%NAME_SERVER	SERVER	NAME SERVER	245	4	Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.	This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.	Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).
314	SERVER%PRINT_SERVER	SERVER	PRINT SERVER	121	2	In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the network where it was available to all the machines in the network.	In this case the printer played the role of a server (often called a print server), and the other machines were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the print server.	Another early application of the client/server model was used to reduce the cost of magnetic disk storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.
315	SERVER%PROXY_SERVER	SERVER	PROXY SERVER	659	4	These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.
316	SERVER%PROXY_SERVER	SERVER	PROXY SERVER	660	4	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
317	SERVER%REMOTE_SERVER	SERVER	REMOTE SERVER	277	1	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.	In line 3, the remote server acknowledges the name of the sending server.	Most internet protocols are not necessarily transmitted in ASCII characters so easily interpreted by a human.
318	SERVER%SECURE_SOCKET_LAYER	SERVER	SECURE SOCKET LAYER	689	1	A prime example is the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol, known as HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure internet access to their accounts.	The backbone of hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers.	Most browsers indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the computer screen.
319	SERVER%SERVER-SIDE	SERVER	SERVER-SIDE	457	3	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
320	SERVER%SERVLETS	SERVER	SERVLETS	474	1	An early means of controlling server-side activities was to use a set of standards called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a server.	A variation of this approach (developed by Sun Microsystems) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the server side.	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.
321	SERVER%SPYWARE	SERVER	SPYWARE	653	1	Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a computer is by establishing contact through a " hole " left by a nonexistent server.	In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine server on the infected computer by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware's findings.	A properly installed firewall could block the messages from these malicious clients.
322	SERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	SERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	364	2	Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.	A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.	It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.
323	SERVER%UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR	SERVER	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	368	2	Sometimes a uniform resource locator might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in Figure 4.8.	For example, if the server does not need to follow a directory path to reach the document, no directory path will appear in the uniform resource locator.	Moreover, sometimes a uniform resource locator will consist of only a protocol and the mnemonic address of a computer.
324	SERVER%WEBSERVER	SERVER	WEBSERVER	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
325	SERVER%WEBSERVERS	SERVER	WEBSERVERS	264	2	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
326	SERVLET%JAVASERVER_PAGE	SERVLET	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	2	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
327	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%INTERNET_MAIL_ACCESS_PROTOCOL	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
328	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%MAIL_SERVER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	MAIL SERVER	270	1	Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.	Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov sending an email from end user " dalek " to end user " doctor " in the domain tardis.edu.	First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the mail server process on mail.tardis.edu.
329	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%PORT_NUMBER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	PORT NUMBER	548	1	For example, if a Web browser is asked to retrieve the document whose uniform resource locator is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the browser assumes that it should contact the hypertext transfer protocol server at www.zoo.org via port number 80.	Likewise, when sending email, an simple mail transfer protocol client assumes that it should communicate with the simple mail transfer protocol mail server through port number 25.	In summary, communication over the Internet involves the interaction of four layers of software.
330	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%POST_OFFICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_3	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3	300	1	There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.	These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced " pop-THREE ") is the simpler of the two.	Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.
331	SIMPLE_MAIL_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL%REMOTE_MAIL_SERVER	SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL	REMOTE MAIL SERVER	275	1	Similarly, when the server process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.	The transcript of their simple mail transfer protocol exchange might look something like this: In line 1, the remote mail server process answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.	In line 2, the sending mail server process introduces itself.
332	SOFTWARE%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	3	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
333	SOFTWARE%APPLICATION_LAYER	SOFTWARE	APPLICATION LAYER	508	1	We begin our journey with the application layer.	The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.
334	SOFTWARE%AUDITING_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	AUDITING SOFTWARE	671	3	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).	Using network auditing software, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator's realm, monitor the activities of the system's firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual computers in order to detect irregularities.
335	SOFTWARE%BROWSER	SOFTWARE	BROWSER	355	2	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
336	SOFTWARE%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE	SOFTWARE	DENIAL OF SERVICE	630	2	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
337	SOFTWARE%DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM	SOFTWARE	DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM	147	2	With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers via networks has become common and multifaceted.	Many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.	Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.
338	SOFTWARE%ENCRYPTION	SOFTWARE	ENCRYPTION	682	1	Thus, a wise computer user never opens email attachments from unfamiliar sources, does not download software without first confirming its reliability, does not respond to pop-up adds, and does not leave a PC connected to the Internet when such connection is not necessary.	Encryption	In some cases the purpose of network vandalism is to disrupt the system (as in denial of service attacks), but in other cases the ultimate goal is to gain access to information.
339	SOFTWARE%FIREWALL	SOFTWARE	FIREWALL	645	1	A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall.	For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing in and out of the region.	Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.
340	SOFTWARE%INTERNET_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	INTERNET SOFTWARE	488	3	We begin by studying the overall structure of this software.	The Layered Approach to Internet Software	A principal task of networking software is to provide the infrastructure required for transferring messages from one machine to another.
341	SOFTWARE%INTERNET_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	INTERNET SOFTWARE	501	3	Each level in the hierarchy has representatives at both the origin and the destination, with the representatives at the destination tending to do the reverse of their counterparts at the origin.	Such is the case with software for controlling communication over the Internet, except that the internet software has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of software routines rather than people and businesses.	The four layers are known as the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the link layer (Figure 4.13).
342	SOFTWARE%MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	MALICIOUS SOFTWARE	598	2	There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.	Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.
343	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	NETWORK SOFTWARE	3	4	In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.	In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.
344	SOFTWARE%NETWORK_SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE	NETWORK SOFTWARE	4	4	The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.	In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.	In this chapter we will explore this expanding field of computer science.
345	SOFTWARE%PROXY_SERVER	SOFTWARE	PROXY SERVER	660	4	Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.
346	SOFTWARE%PROXY_SERVER	SOFTWARE	PROXY SERVER	661	4	A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.	Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.	Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about the intranet's internal structure-information that can later be used for malicious activity.
347	SOFTWARE%SECURE_SHELL	SOFTWARE	SECURE SHELL	510	1	Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.
348	SOFTWARE%SPYWARE	SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
349	SOFTWARE%TROJAN_HORSE	SOFTWARE	TROJAN HORSE	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
350	SOFTWARE%VIRUS	SOFTWARE	VIRUS	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
351	SOFTWARE%WEBSERVERS	SOFTWARE	WEBSERVERS	355	1	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
352	SOFTWARE%WORM	SOFTWARE	WORM	600	2	Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.	Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.	The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.
353	SPYWARE%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	SPYWARE	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	675	1	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.	For example, whereas many products specialize in virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.
354	SPYWARE%PHISHING	SPYWARE	PHISHING	623	2	In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.	As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.	The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous " lines " in hopes that someone will " take the bait ".
355	STAR%ACCESS_POINT	STAR	ACCESS POINT	28	2	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
356	STAR%WIRELESS_NETWORK	STAR	WIRELESS NETWORK	28	4	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
357	SWITCH%ROUTER	SWITCH	ROUTER	98	1	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.	Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.	As an example, Figure 4.5 depicts two wifi star networks and an Ethernet bus network connected by routers.
358	TAG%BODY	TAG	BODY	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
359	TAG%HEAD	TAG	HEAD	384	1	Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.	The hypertext markup language source document consists of two sections-a head (surrounded by the < head > and < / head > tags) and a body (surrounded by the < body > and < / body > tags).	The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.
360	TAG%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	TAG	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	378	2	The distinction is that a hypertext document also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.	This system of tags is known as hypertext markup language (HTML).	Thus, it is in terms of hypertext markup language that an author of a webpage describes the information that a browser needs in order to present the page on the user's screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.
361	TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	180	2	An example would be a company that originated as a traditional telephone company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.	Connecting to the tier-1 internet service providers are the tier-2 internet service providers that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.	The distinction between the tier-1 and tier-2 internet service providers is often a matter of opinion.
362	TIER-2_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER%TIER-3_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	TIER-2 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	TIER-3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	185	2	As such, they can be thought of as the core of the Internet.	Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 internet service provider.	An access internet service provider is essentially an independent internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying internet access to individual homes and businesses.
363	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%1G	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	1G	332	2	The first generation wireless telephone network transmitted analog voice signals through the air, much like traditional telephones but without the copper wire running into the wall.	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.
364	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%INTERNET	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	INTERNET	96	1	There are many other examples of internets.	Indeed, traditional telephone communication was handled by worldwide internet systems well before the Internet was popularized.	The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.
365	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%SECOND_GENERATION	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	SECOND GENERATION	333	1	In retrospect, we call these early phones " 1G ", or first generation.	The second generation used digital signals to encode voice, providing more effective use of the airwaves, and the transmission of other kinds of digital data, like text messaging.	The Third Generation (" 3G ") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.
366	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	1	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
367	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	306	3	VoIP	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.
368	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	307	3	As an example of a more recent Internet application, consider voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in which the internet infrastructure is used to provide voice communication similar to that of traditional telephone systems.	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.	However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking voice over internet protocol with traditional telephone systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond traditional Internet applications.
369	TRADITIONAL_TELEPHONE%VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL	TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	308	3	In its simplest form, voice over internet protocol consists of two processes on different machines transferring audio data via the peer-to-peer model-a process that in itself presents no significant problems.	However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking voice over internet protocol with traditional telephone systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond traditional Internet applications.	Moreover, governments that own their country's traditional telephone companies view voice over internet protocol as a threat and have either taxed it heavily or outlawed it completely.
370	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL%FORWARDING_TABLE	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	FORWARDING TABLE	581	1	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.	We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.	For instance, a router may malfunction, meaning that traffic should no longer be forwarded in its direction, or a section of the Internet may become congested, meaning that traffic should be routed around the blockage.
371	TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	565	1	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
372	TRANSPORT_LAYER%APPLICATION_LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	APPLICATION LAYER	511	1	For example, software for transferring files using file transfer protocol or for providing remote login capabilities using secure shell have become so common that they are normally considered utility software.	The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages.	Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the shipping company, it is the application layer's responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the internet infrastructure.
373	TRANSPORT_LAYER%NETWORK_LAYER	TRANSPORT LAYER	NETWORK LAYER	519	1	The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message's destination.	Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.	From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they reach the transport layer at their final destination.
374	TRANSPORT_LAYER%PORT_NUMBER	TRANSPORT LAYER	PORT NUMBER	544	2	Determining which unit within the application layer should receive an incoming message is an important task of the transport layer.	This is handled by assigning unique port numbers (not related to the I/O ports discussed in Chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate port number be appended to a message's address before starting the message on its journey.	Then, once the message is received by the transport layer at the destination, the transport layer merely hands the message to the application layer software at the designated port number.
375	TRANSPORT_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	562	2	Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).
376	TRANSPORT_LAYER%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL	565	2	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
377	TRANSPORT_LAYER%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	563	4	More precisely, transmission control protocol defines a version of the transport layer.	We say a version because the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the transport layer; one of the other options is defined by the user datagram protocol (UDP).	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.
378	TRANSPORT_LAYER%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	565	4	This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.	Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the application layer might choose to send data via a transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol version of the transport layer (Figure 4.15).	There are several differences between transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
379	TRANSPORT_LAYER%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	TRANSPORT LAYER	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	570	4	In this manner, a transmission control protocol transport layer is said to establish a connection before sending a message.	A transport layer based on user datagram protocol does not establish such a connection prior to sending a message.	It merely sends the message to the address it was given and forgets about it.
380	UNIFORM_RESOURCE_LOCATOR%HYPERTEXT_MARKUP_LANGUAGE	UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR	HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE	375	1	These browsers correctly retrieve the Google home page when given the " uniform resource locator " consisting merely of www .google. com.	hypertext markup language	A traditional hypertext document is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ASCII or Unicode.
381	VIRUS%ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE	VIRUS	ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE	674	2	In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.	Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.	Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.
382	VIRUS%PROXY_SERVER	VIRUS	PROXY SERVER	670	1	The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client.	For example, an file transfer protocol proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.	Still another tool for preventing problems in a network environment is auditing software that is similar to the auditing software we learned about in our discussion on operating system security (Section 3.5).
383	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%TRANSMISSION_CONTROL_PROTOCOL/INTERNET_PROTOCOL_NETWORK	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK	318	2	This choice is frequently bundled with traditional Internet service and/or digital television service.	The third type of voice over internet protocol comes in the form of embedded voice over internet protocol phones, which are devices that replace a traditional telephone with an equivalent handset connected directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol network.	Embedded voice over internet protocol phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with voice over internet protocol over Ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.
384	VOICE_OVER_INTERNET_PROTOCOL%USER_DATAGRAM_PROTOCOL	VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL	USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL	579	1	After all, a transport layer based on user datagram protocol is more streamlined than a layer based on transmission control protocol, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of user datagram protocol, that option might be the better choice.	For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.	However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.
385	WEBSERVER%ACTIVE_SERVER_PAGE	WEBSERVER	ACTIVE SERVER PAGE	477	1	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).	In contrast to these proprietary systems, PHP (originally standing for Personal Home Page but now considered to mean PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing server-side functionality.
386	WEBSERVER%CLIENT-SIDE	WEBSERVER	CLIENT-SIDE	457	1	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
387	WEBSERVER%DENIAL_OF_SERVICE	WEBSERVER	DENIAL OF SERVICE	630	2	In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system.	An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company's business and in some cases have brought the company's commercial activity to a halt.	A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages over a brief period of time.
388	WEBSERVER%HYPERTEXT	WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT	355	1	Web Implementation	Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.	A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.
389	WEBSERVER%HYPERTEXT_DOCUMENT	WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT	358	1	Common Internet browsers include Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.	The webserver resides on a computer containing hypertext documents to be accessed.	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).
390	WEBSERVER%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	WEBSERVER	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	264	1	A newsreader application contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the file transfer protocol (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol, or later the secure shell (SSH) protocol.	As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler examples before moving on to hypertext transfer protocol in the next section.
391	WEBSERVER%JAVASERVER_PAGE	WEBSERVER	JAVASERVER PAGE	476	2	A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested server-side activity is the construction of a customized webpage, as in our travel agent example.	In this case webpage templates called javaserver pages (JSP) are stored at the webserver and completed using information received from a client.	A similar approach is used by Microsoft, where the templates from which customized webpages are constructed are called active server pages (ASP).
392	WEBSERVER%SERVER-SIDE	WEBSERVER	SERVER-SIDE	457	2	These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.	Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).	As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.
393	WEBSERVERS%HYPERTEXT_TRANSFER_PROTOCOL	WEBSERVERS	HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL	360	1	Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (browsers).	Hypertext documents are normally transferred between browsers and webservers using a protocol known as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).	In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL).
394	WIDE_AREA_NETWORK%INTERNET	WIDE AREA NETWORK	INTERNET	169	1	Much of this work was sponsored by the U.S. government through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-pronounced " DAR-pa ").	Over the years, the development of the Internet shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of personal area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks involving millions of computers.	Internet Architecture
395	WIDE_AREA_NETWORK%TIER-1_INTERNET_SERVICE_PROVIDER	WIDE AREA NETWORK	TIER-1 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER	176	1	The system of networks operated by the internet service providers can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall Internet structure (Figure 4.7).	At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 internet service providers that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international wide area networks.	These networks are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.
396	WIFI_NETWORK%ACCESS_POINT	WIFI NETWORK	ACCESS POINT	28	1	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
397	WIRELESS_NETWORK%ACCESS_POINT	WIRELESS NETWORK	ACCESS POINT	28	3	As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small computers themselves, a star network emerged.	Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless networks where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central machine, called the access point (AP), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.	The difference between a bus network and a star network is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.
398	WIRELESS_NETWORK%CARRIER_SENSE_,_MULTIPLE_ACCESS_WITH_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	WIRELESS NETWORK	CARRIER SENSE , MULTIPLE ACCESS WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE	57	2	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.
399	WIRELESS_NETWORK%COLLISION_AVOIDANCE	WIRELESS NETWORK	COLLISION AVOIDANCE	58	1	Such policies are classified as carrier sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), many of which are standardized by IEEE (see the sidebar " Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers " in Chapter 7) within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.	We emphasize that collision avoidance protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.	When collisions do occur, messages must be retransmitted.
400	WIRELESS_NETWORK%HIDDEN_TERMINAL_PROBLEM	WIRELESS NETWORK	HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM	55	1	For example, the machine may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other machine.	Another cause might be that the signals from the different machines are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the central access point (a condition known as the hidden terminal problem, Figure 4.3).	The result is that wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.

Today world wide web consortium is the source of many standards (including standards for extensible markup language and numerous multimedia applications) that lead to compatibility over a wide range of Internet products.

His first software for implementing the Web was released in December, 1990.

While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the world wide web: a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the network, and a server process that supplied hypertext pages upon request.	From this humble beginning, the Web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the Internet.

The semantic approach would allow search engines (websites that assist users in locating Web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.	More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a search engine can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement " This lasagna does not contain spinach ".
